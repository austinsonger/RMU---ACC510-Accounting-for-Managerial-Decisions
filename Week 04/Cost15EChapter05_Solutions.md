CHAPTER 5

ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING AND ACTIVITY-BASED MANAGEMENT

**5-1** Broad averaging (or “peanut-butter costing”) describes a costing approach that uses broad averages for assigning (or spreading, as in spreading peanut butter) the cost of resources uniformly to cost objects when the individual products or services, in fact, use those resources in non-uniform ways.

Broad averaging, by ignoring the variation in the consumption of resources by different cost objects, can lead to inaccurate and misleading cost data, which in turn can negatively impact the marketing and operating decisions made based on that information.

**5-2** Overcosting may result in overpricing and competitors entering a market and taking market share for products that a company erroneously believes are low-margin or even unprofitable.

Undercosting may result in companies selling products on which they are in fact losing money, when they erroneously believe them to be profitable.

**5-3** Costing system refinement means making changes to a simple costing system that reduces the use of broad averages for assigning the cost of resources to cost objects and provides better measurement of the costs of overhead resources used by different cost objects.

Three guidelines for refinement are

> 1. Classify as many of the total costs as direct costs as is economically feasible.
>
> 2. Expand the number of indirect cost pools until each of these pools is more homogenous.
>
> 3. Use the cause-and-effect criterion, when possible, to identify the cost-allocation base for each indirect-cost pool.

**5-4** An activity-based approach refines a costing system by focusing on individual activities (events, tasks, or units of work with a specified purpose) as the fundamental cost objects. It uses the cost of these activities as the basis for assigning costs to other cost objects such as products or services.

**5-5** Four levels of a cost hierarchy are

> (i) Output unit-level costs: costs of activities performed on each individual unit of a product or service.
>
> (ii) Batch-level costs: costs of activities related to a group of units of products or services rather than to each individual unit of product or service.

1.  Product-sustaining costs or service-sustaining costs: costs of activities undertaken to support individual products or services regardless of the number of units or batches in which the units are produced.

> (iv) Facility-sustaining costs: costs of activities that cannot be traced to individual products or services but support the organization as a whole.

**5-6** It is important to classify costs into a cost hierarchy because costs in different cost pools relate to different cost-allocation bases and not all cost-allocation bases are unit level. For example, an allocation base like setup hours is a batch-level allocation base, and design hours is a product-sustaining base, both insensitive to the number of units in a batch or the number of units of product produced. If costs were not classified into a cost hierarchy, the alternative would be to consider all costs as unit-level costs, leading to misallocation of those costs that are not unit-level costs.

**5-7** An ABC approach focuses on activities as the fundamental cost objects. The costs of these activities are built up to compute the costs of products, and services, and so on. Simple costing systems have one or a few indirect cost pools, irrespective of the heterogeneity in the facility while ABC systems have multiple indirect cost pools. An ABC approach attempts to use cost drivers as the allocation base for indirect costs, whereas a simple costing system generally does not. The ABC approach classifies as many indirect costs as direct costs as possible. A simple costing system has more indirect costs.

**5-8** Four decisions for which ABC information is useful are

> 1. pricing and product mix decisions,
>
> 2. cost reduction and process improvement decisions,
>
> 3. product design decisions, and
>
> 4. decisions for planning and managing activities.

**5-9** No. Department indirect-cost rates are similar to activity-cost rates if (1) a single activity accounts for a sizable fraction of the department’s costs, or (2) significant costs are incurred on different activities within a department but each activity has the same cost-allocation base, or (3) significant costs are incurred on different activities with different cost-allocation bases within a department but different products use resources from the different activity areas in the same proportions.

**5-10** “Tell-tale” signs that indicate when ABC systems are likely to provide the most benefits are as follows:

> 1. Significant amounts of indirect costs are allocated using only one or two cost pools.
>
> 2. All or most indirect costs are identified as output-unit-level costs (i.e., few indirect costs are described as batch-level, product-sustaining, or facility-sustaining costs).
>
> 3. Products make diverse demands on resources because of differences in volume, process steps, batch size, or complexity.
>
> 4. Products that a company is well suited to make and sell show small profits, whereas products that a company is less suited to produce and sell show large profits.
>
> 5. Operations staff has significant disagreements with the accounting staff about the costs of manufacturing and marketing products and services.

**5-11** The main costs and limitations of ABC are the measurements necessary to implement the systems. Even basic ABC systems require many calculations to determine costs of products and services. Activity-cost rates often need to be updated regularly. Very detailed ABC systems are costly to operate and difficult to understand. Sometimes the allocations necessary to calculate activity costs often result in activity-cost pools and quantities of cost-allocation bases being measured with error. When measurement errors are large, activity-cost information can be misleading.

**5-12** No, ABC systems apply equally well to service companies such as banks, railroads, hospitals, and accounting firms, as well merchandising companies such as retailers and distributors when products make diverse demands on resources because of differences in volume, process steps, batch size, or complexity.

**5-13** No. An activity-based approach should be adopted only if its expected benefits exceed its expected costs. It is not always a wise investment. If the jobs, products, or services are alike in the way they consume indirect costs of a company, then a simple costing system will suffice.

**5-14** Increasing the number of indirect-cost pools does NOT guarantee increased accuracy of product or service costs. If the existing cost pool is already homogeneous, increasing the number of cost pools will not increase accuracy. If the existing cost pool is not homogeneous, accuracy will increase only if the increased cost pools themselves increase in homogeneity vis-à-vis the single cost pool.

**5-15** The controller faces a difficult challenge. The benefits of a better accounting system show up in improved decisions by managers. It is important that the controller have the support of these managers when seeking increased investments in accounting systems. Statements by these managers showing how their decisions will be improved by a better accounting system are the controller’s best arguments when seeking increased funding. For example, the new system will result in more accurate product costs, which will influence pricing and product mix decisions. The new system can also be used to reduce product costs, which will lower selling prices. As a result, the customer will benefit from the new system.

**5-16** (20 min.) **Cost hierarchy.**

1.  a. Indirect manufacturing labor costs of $825,000 support direct manufacturing labor and are output unit-level costs. Direct manufacturing labor generally increases with output units and so will the indirect costs to support it.

b. Batch-level costs are costs of activities that are related to a group of units of a product rather than each individual unit of a product. Purchase order-related costs (including costs of receiving materials and paying suppliers) of $525,000 relate to a group of units of product and are batch-level costs.

c. Cost of indirect materials of $160,000 generally changes with labor hours or machine hours which are unit-level costs. Therefore, indirect material costs are output unit-level costs.

d. Setup costs of $365,000 are batch-level costs because they relate to a group of units of product produced after the machines are set up.

> e. Costs of designing processes, drawing process charts, and making engineering changes for individual products, $287,500, are product sustaining because they relate to the costs of activities undertaken to support individual products regardless of the number of units or batches in which the product is produced.

f. Machine-related overhead costs (depreciation and maintenance) of $950,000 are output unit-level costs because they change with the number of units produced.

g. Plant management, plant rent, and insurance costs of $512,000 are facility-sustaining costs because the costs of these activities cannot be traced to individual products or services but support the organization as a whole.

2. The complex karaoke machine made in many batches will use significantly more batch-level overhead resources compared to the simple karaoke machine that is made in a few batches. In addition, the complex karaoke machine will use more product-sustaining overhead resources because it is complex. Because each karaoke machine requires the same amount of machine-hours, both the simple and the complex karaoke machine will be allocated the same amount of overhead costs per karaoke machine if Forrester uses only machine-hours to allocate overhead costs to karaoke machines. As a result, the complex karaoke machine will be undercosted (it consumes a relatively high level of resources but is reported to have a relatively low cost) and the simple karaoke machine will be overcosted (it consumes a relatively low level of resources but is reported to have a relatively high cost).

3. Using the cost hierarchy to calculate activity-based costs can help Forrester to identify both the costs of individual activities and the cost of activities demanded by individual products. Forrester can use this information to manage its business in several ways:

> a. Pricing and product mix decisions. Knowing the resources needed to manufacture and sell different types of karaoke machines can help Forrester to price the different karaoke machines and also identify which karaoke machines are more profitable. It can then emphasize its more profitable products.
>
> b. Forrester can use information about the costs of different activities to improve processes and reduce costs of the different activities. Forrester could have a target of reducing costs of activities (setups, order processing, etc.) by, say, 3% and constantly seek to eliminate activities and costs (such as engineering changes) that its customers perceive as not adding value.
>
> c. Forrester management can identify and evaluate new designs to improve performance by analyzing how product and process designs affect activities and costs.
>
> d. Forrester can use its ABC systems and cost hierarchy information to plan and manage activities. What activities should be performed in the period and at what cost?

**5-17** (25 min.) **ABC, cost hierarchy, service.**

1. Output unit-level costs

a. Direct-labor costs, $146,000

b. Equipment-related costs (rent, maintenance, energy, and so on), $350,000

> These costs are output unit-level costs because they are incurred on each unit of materials tested, that is, for every hour of testing.

Batch-level costs

c. Setup costs, $430,000

> These costs are batch-level costs because they are incurred each time a batch of materials is set up for either HT or ST, regardless of the number of hours for which the tests are subsequently run.

Service-sustaining costs

d. Costs of designing tests, $264,000.

> These costs are service-sustaining costs because they are incurred to design the HT and ST tests, regardless of the number of batches tested or the number of hours of test time.

\*$350,000 ÷ (40,000 + 30,000) hours = $5 per test-hour

<sup>†</sup>$430,000 ÷ (13,600 + 3,600) setup hours = $25 per setup-hour

\*\*$264,000 ÷ (3,000 + 1,400) hours = $60 per hour

At a cost per test-hour of $17, the simple costing system undercosts heat testing ($20.50) and overcosts stress testing ($12.33). The reason is that heat testing uses direct labor, setup, and design resources per hour more intensively than stress testing. Heat tests are more complex, take longer to set up, and are more difficult to design. The simple costing system assumes that testing costs per hour are the same for heat testing and stress testing.

3. The ABC system better captures the resources needed for heat testing and stress testing because it identifies all the various activities undertaken when performing the tests and recognizes the levels of the cost hierarchy at which costs vary. Hence, the ABC system generates more accurate product costs.

Vineyard’s management can use the information from the ABC system to make better pricing and product mix decisions. For example, it might decide to increase the prices charged for the more costly heat testing and consider reducing prices on the less costly stress testing. Vineyard should watch if competitors are underbidding Vineyard in stress testing and causing it to lose business. Vineyard can also use ABC information to reduce costs by eliminating processes and activities that do not add value, identifying and evaluating new methods to do testing that reduce the activities needed to do the tests, reducing the costs of doing various activities, and planning and managing activities.

***Requirement 1* *Requirement 2***

San Antonio Dominion $28,132 $26,890

Amsterdam Enterprises *14,092* *16,090*

$42,224 $42,980

Both clients use 70 hours of professional labor time. However, San Antonio Dominion uses a higher proportion of Walliston’s time (26 hours), which is more costly. This attracts the highest support-services charge when allocated on the basis of direct professional labor costs.

3. Assume that the Walliston Group uses a cause-and-effect criterion when choosing the allocation base for support services. You could use several pieces of evidence to determine whether professional labor costs or hours is the driver of support-service costs:

> a. *Interviews with personnel*. For example, staff in the major cost categories in support services could be interviewed to determine whether Walliston requires more support per hour than, say, Abbington. The professional labor costs allocation base implies that an hour of Walliston’s time requires 6.40 ($640 ÷ $100) times more support-service dollars than does an hour of Abbington’s time.
>
> b. *Analysis of tasks undertaken for selected clients*. For example, if computer-related costs are a sizable part of support costs, you could determine if there was a systematic relationship between the percentage involvement of professionals with high billing rates on cases and the computer resources consumed for those cases.

The United Motors contract uses only 3% of total machines hours in 2011, yet uses 28% of CAD design-hours and 19% of engineering hours. The result is that the plantwide rate, based on machine hours, will greatly underestimate the cost of resources used on the United Motors contract. This explains the 157% increase in indirect costs assigned to the United Motors contract when department rates are used. The Leland Auto contract also uses far fewer machine-hours than engineering-hours and is also undercosted.

In contrast, the Holden Motors contract uses less of design (51%) and engineering (16%) than of machine-hours (70%). Hence, the use of department rates will report lower indirect costs for Holden Motors than does a plantwide rate.

Holden Motors was probably complaining under the use of the simple system because its contract was being overcosted relative to its consumption of MOH resources. United and Leland, on the other hand, were having their contracts undercosted and underpriced by the simple system. Assuming that AP is an efficient and competitive supplier, if the new department-based rates are used to price contracts, United and Leland will be unhappy. AP should explain to United and Leland how the calculation was done, and point out United’s high use of design and engineering resources and Leland’s high use of engineering resources relative to production machine hours. Discuss ways of reducing the consumption of those resources, if possible, and show willingness to partner with them to do so. If the price rise is going to be steep, perhaps offer to phase in the new prices.

4. Other than for pricing, AP can also use the information from the department-based system to examine and streamline its own operations so that there is maximum value-added from all indirect resources. It might set targets over time to reduce both the consumption of each indirect resource and the unit costs of the resources. The department-based system gives AP more opportunities for targeted cost management.

5. It would not be worthwhile to further refine the cost system into an ABC system if (1) a single activity accounts for a sizable proportion of the department’s costs or (2) significant costs are incurred on different activities within a department, but each activity has the same cost driver or (3) there wasn’t much variation among contracts in the consumption of activities within a department. If, for example, most activities within the design department were, in fact, driven by CAD-design hours, then the more refined system would be more costly and no more accurate than the department-based cost system. Even if there was sufficient variation, considering the relative sizes of the three department cost pools, it may only be cost-effective to further analyze the engineering cost pool, which consumes 78% ($240,000$308,600) of the manufacturing overhead.

4. As Triumph uses more refined cost pools, the costs of trophies decreases, and costs of plaques increases. This is because plaques use a higher proportion of cost drivers (batches of set ups and direct manufacturing labor costs) than trophies, whereas the direct costs (the allocation base used in the simple costing system) are slightly smaller for plaques compared to trophies. This results in plaques being undercosted and trophies overcosted in the simple costing system.

Department costing systems increase the costs of plaques relative to trophies because the forming department costs are allocated based on direct manufacturing labor costs in the forming department and plaques use more direct manufacturing labor in this department compared to trophies.

Disaggregated information can improve decisions by allowing managers to see the details that help them understand how different aspects of cost influence total cost per unit. Managers can also understand the drivers of different cost categories and use this information for pricing and product-mix decisions, cost reduction and process-improvement decisions, design decisions, and to plan and manage activities. However, too much detail can overload managers who don’t understand the data or what it means. Also, managers looking at per-unit data may be misled when considering costs that aren’t unit-level costs.

The Sanders project uses only 10% of design-hours in 2014 and uses 32% of engineering-hours and 33% of construction hours. The result is that the overhead rate, based on allocating costs equally to all projects (33%), will greatly overestimate the cost of resources used on the Sanders project, which uses very few design-hours. This explains the 26% decrease in indirect costs assigned to the Sanders project when department rates are used.

In contrast, the Hanley and Stanley projects use more of design (50% and 40%, respectively). Hence, the use of department rates will report higher indirect costs for Hanley and Stanley than does a single overhead rate.

Sanders was probably complaining about the costs resulting from using the simple system because its project was being overcosted relative to its consumption of overhead resources. Hanley and Stanley, on the other hand, were having their projects undercosted and underpriced by the simple system. If the new department-based rates are used to price projects, Hanley and Stanley will be unhappy. CKM should explain to Hanley and Stanley how the calculations were done and point out their high use of design resources. CKM should discuss ways of reducing the consumption of design resources, if possible, and show willingness to partner with them to do so. CKM could even offer to phase in the new prices.

It would not be worthwhile to further refine the cost system into an ABC system if (1) a single activity accounts for a sizable proportion of the department’s costs or (2) significant costs are incurred on different activities within a department, but each activity has the same cost driver or (3) there wasn’t much variation among contracts in the consumption of activities within a department. If, for example, most activities within the design department were, in fact, driven by design-hours, then the more refined system would be more costly and no more accurate than the department-based cost system.

Relative to the ABC system, the simple costing system overcosts standard jobs and undercosts special jobs. Both types of jobs need 10 machine hours per job, so in the simple system, they are each allocated $335.83 in indirect costs. But, the ABC study reveals that each standard job consumes less of the indirect resources such as setups, purchase orders, and design costs than a special job, and this is reflected in the lower indirect costs allocated to the standard jobs and higher indirect costs allocated to special jobs in the ABC system.

4. Speediprint can use the information revealed by the ABC system to change its pricing based on the ABC costs. Under the simple system, Speediprint was making a gross margin of 12% on each standard job (\[$600 – $525.83\] $600) and 25% on each special job (\[$750 – $560.83\] $750). But, the ABC system reveals that it is actually making a gross margin of 21% (\[$600 – $473.57\]$600) on each standard job and about 11% (\[$750 – $665.36\] $750) on each special job. Depending on the market competitiveness, Speediprint may either want to reprice the different types of jobs, or it may choose to market standard jobs more aggressively than before.

Speediprint can also use the ABC information to improve its own operations. It could examine each of the indirect cost categories and analyze whether it would be possible to deliver the same level of service, but consume fewer indirect resources, or find a way to reduce the per-unit-cost-driver cost of some of those indirect resources.

Relative to the ABC system, the simple costing system overcosts interior doors and undercosts exterior doors. Interior doors require 1.72 machine-hours per unit while exterior doors require 2.5 machine-hours per unit. In the simple-costing system, overhead costs are allocated to the interior and exterior doors on the basis of the machine-hours used by each type of door. The ABC study reveals that the ratio of the cost of production runs, material moves, and setups for each exterior door versus each interior door is even higher than the ratio of 2.5 to 1.72 machine-hours for each exterior relative to each interior door. This higher ratio results in higher indirect costs allocated to exterior doors relative to interior doors in the ABC system.

4. Fancy Doors, Inc. can use the information revealed by the ABC system to change its pricing based on the ABC costs. Under the simple system, Fancy Doors was making an operating margin of 21.6% on each interior door (\[$250 – $195.93\] $250) and 27.5% on each exterior door (\[$400 – $289.90\] $400). But, the ABC system reveals that it is actually making an operating margin of about 32% (\[$250 – $170.20\]$250) on each interior door and about 16% (\[$400 – $335.64\] $400) on each exterior door. Fancy Doors, Inc., should consider decreasing the price of its interior doors to be more competitive. Fancy Doors should also consider increasing the price of its exterior doors, depending on the competition it faces in this market.

Fancy Doors can also use the ABC information to improve its own operations. It could examine each of the indirect cost categories and analyze whether it would be possible to deliver the same level of service, but consume fewer indirect resources, or find a way to reduce the per-unit-cost-driver cost of some of those indirect resources. Making these operational improvements can help Fancy Doors to reduce costs, become more competitive, and reduce prices to gain further market share while increasing its profits.

The baked goods line drops sizably in profitability when ABC is used. Although it constitutes 30.71% of COGS, it uses a higher percentage of total resources in each activity area, especially the high-cost delivery activity area. In contrast, frozen products draw a much lower percentage of total resources used in each activity area than its percentage of total COGS. Hence, under ABC, frozen products are much more profitable.

Henderson Supermarkets may want to explore ways to increase sales of frozen products. It may also want to explore price increases on baked goods.

The analysis indicates that customers’ profitability (loss) contribution varies widely from (14.2%) to 15.0%. Immediate attention to Chain 2 is required which is currently showing a loss contribution. The chain has a disproportionate number of both regular orders and rush orders. Ramirez should work with the management of Chain 2 to find ways to reduce the number of orders while maintaining or increasing the sales volume. If this is not possible, Ramirez should consider dropping Chain 2 if it can save the customer-related costs.

Chain 1 has a disproportionate number of the items returned as well as sale returns. The causes of these should be investigated so that the profitability contribution of Chain 1 could be improved.

Assuming the ABC numbers are more accurate, potato cuts sold to the retail market are undercosted, while potato cuts sold to the institutional market are overcosted.

The simple costing system assumes each product uses all the activity areas in a homogeneous way. This is not the case. Institutional sales use sizably less resources in the cutting area and the packaging area. The percentages of total costs for each cost category are as follows:

***Retail* *Institutional* *Total***

Direct costs

 Direct materials 90.0% 10.0% 100.0%
------------------------------------

Packaging 95.5 4.5 100.0

Cutting 92.3 7.7 100.0

Packaging 96.6 3.4 100.0

Units produced 90.0% 10.0% 100.0%

Intex can use the revised cost information for a variety of purposes:

a. *Pricing/product emphasis decisions.* The sizable drop in the reported cost of potatoes sold in the institutional market makes it possible that Intex was overpricing potato products in this market. It lost the bid for a large institutional contract with a bid 30% above the winning bid. With its revised product cost dropping from $1.20 to $0.794, Intex could have bid much lower and still made a profit. An increased emphasis on the institutional market appears warranted.

b. *Product design decisions.* ABC provides a road map as to how to reduce the costs of individual products. The relative components of costs are:

***Retail*** ***Institutional***

> Packaging-related costs constitute 42.7% (10.6% + 32.1%) of total costs of the retail product line. Design efforts that reduce packaging costs can have a big impact on reducing total unit costs for retail.
>
> c. *Process improvements.* Each activity area is now highlighted as a separate cost. The three indirect cost areas comprise over 70% of total costs for each product, indicating the upside from improvements in the efficiency of processes in these activity areas.

3. The manufacturing manager likely would find the ABC job-costing system more useful in cost management. Unlike direct manufacturing labor costs, the five indirect cost pools are systematically linked to the activity areas at the plant. The result is more accurate product costing. The manufacturing manager can seek to reduce both the level of activity (fewer purchase orders, less material handling) and the cost of each activity (such as the cost per inspection).

Marketing managers can use ABC information to bid for jobs more competitively because ABC provides managers with a more accurate reflection of the resources used for and the costs of each job.

The assumption that the Lindell and Colston accounts exceed $1,000 every month and the Welker account is less than $1,000 each month means the monthly charges apply only to Welker.

One student with a banking background noted that in this solution 100% of the spread is attributed to the “depositor side of the bank.” He noted that often the spread is divided between the “depositor side” and the “lending side” of the bank.

2. Cross-subsidization across individual Premier Accounts occurs when profits made on some accounts are offset by losses on other accounts. The aggregate profitability on the three customers is $449.20. The Colston account is highly profitable, $602.30, while the Lindell account is sizably unprofitable. The Welker account shows a small profit but only because of the $264 monthly fees. It is unlikely that Welker will keep paying these high fees and that USB would want Welker to pay such high fees from a customer relationship standpoint.

The facts also suggest that the customers do not use the bank services uniformly. For example, Lindell and Welker have a lot of transactions with the teller and also inquire about their account balances more often than Colston. This suggests cross-subsidization. USB should be very concerned about the cross-subsidization. Competition likely would “understand” that high-balance low-activity type accounts (such as Colston) are highly profitable. Offering free services to these customers is not likely to retain these accounts if other banks offer higher interest rates. Competition likely will reduce the interest rate spread USB can earn on the high-balance low-activity accounts they are able to retain.

3. Possible changes USB could make are:

> a. Offer higher interest rates on high-balance accounts to increase USB’s competitiveness in attracting and retaining these accounts.
>
> b. Introduce charges for individual services. The ABC study reports the cost of each service. USB has to decide if it wants to price each service at cost, below cost, or above cost. If it prices above cost, it may use advertising and other means to encourage additional use of those services by customers. Of course, in determining its pricing strategy, USB would need to consider how other competing banks are pricing their products and services.

1. Pricing decisions at Bradley Associates are heavily influenced by reported cost numbers. Suppose Bradley is bidding against another firm for a client with a job similar to that of Campa Coal. If the costing system overstates the costs of these jobs, Bradley may bid too high and fail to land the client. If the costing system understates the costs of these jobs, Bradley may bid low, land the client, and then lose money in handling the case.

The Problem 5-31 approach directly traces $15,000 of general support costs to the individual jobs. In Problem 5-30, these costs are allocated on the basis of direct professional labor-hours. The averaging assumption implicit in the Problem 5-30 approach appears incorrect—for example, the St. Edith’s Glass job has travel costs six times higher than the Campa Coal case despite having lower direct professional labor-hours.

The Campa Coal case makes relatively low use of the higher-cost partners but relatively higher use of the lower-cost associates than does St. Edith’s Glass. As a result, it also uses less of the higher indirect costs required to support partners compared to associates. The Campa Coal case also makes relatively lower use of the support labor, computer time, travel, phones/faxes, and photocopying resource areas than does the St. Edith’s Glass case.

2. The specific areas where the multiple direct/multiple indirect (MD/MI) approach can provide better information for decisions at Bradley Associates include the following:

*Pricing and product (case) emphasis decisions*. In a bidding situation using single direct/single indirect (SD/SI) or multiple direct/single indirect (MD/SI) data, Bradley may win bids for legal cases on which it will subsequently lose money. It may also not win bids on which it would make money with a lower-priced bid.

From a strategic viewpoint, SD/SI or MD/SI exposes Bradley Associates to cherry-picking by competitors. Other law firms may focus exclusively on Campa Coal-type cases and take sizable amounts of “profitable” business from Bradley Associates. MD/MI reduces the likelihood of Bradley Associates losing cases on which it would have made money.

*Client relationships.* MD/MI provides a better “road map” for clients to understand how costs are accumulated at Bradley Associates. Bradley can use this road map when meeting with clients to plan the work to be done on a case *before* it commences. Clients can negotiate ways to get a lower-cost case from Bradley, given the information in MD/MI—for example, (a) use a higher proportion of associate labor time and a lower proportion of a partner time, and (b) use fax machines more and air travel less. If clients are informed in advance how costs will be accumulated, there is less likelihood of disputes about bills submitted to them *after* the work is done.

*Cost control.* The MD/MI approach better highlights the individual cost areas at Bradley Associates than does the SD/SI or MD/SI approaches:

*MD/MI* *SD/SI* *MD/SI*

Number of direct cost categories 7 1 7

Number of indirect cost categories *2* *1* *1*

Total 9 2 8

MD/MI is likely to promote better cost-control practices than SD/SI or MD/SI, as the nine cost categories in MD/MI give Bradley a better handle on how to effectively manage different categories of both direct and indirect costs.

3. Because only about 20% of the orders that Thurgood receives require custom designs, it is important that the costs generated by custom designs are not allocated to non-custom orders. Activity-based costing allows Thurgood to only assign resources used by orders to the orders. Similarly, order processing costs of $456/order are assigned to each order, regardless of the size of the order. Activity-based costing leads to more accurate costing of orders. This, in turn, leads to more competitive pricing. If Thurgood allocated all overhead costs to orders on the basis of direct manufacturing labor hours, they would tend to overprice larger, non-custom orders and underprice smaller, custom orders. They would likely lose bids on the overpriced orders and win the underpriced orders, but then lose money on the bids they won because the actual costs would be much greater than the estimated costs. The underpriced bids have small direct manufacturing labor hours relative to the resources needed to support custom designs and order processing costs for small orders.

4. Because the landscape design and estimating costs are only incurred once for the entire job, bidding on 2 years of service may allow LawnCare USA to be more competitive on a yearly basis. However, submitting an estimate for 2 years would lock LawnCare USA into the same price for both years, regardless of possible increases in their costs.

3. Using the disaggregated activity-based costing data, managers can see that the MRI actually costs substantially more and x-rays, ultrasounds, and CT scans substantially less than the traditional system indicated. In particular, the MRI activity generates a lot of maintenance activity and sanitation activity. Managers should examine the use of these two activities to search for ways to reduce the activity consumption and ultimately its cost.

> 1. Mom-and-Pop Single Stores 9.09% 1. Drugstore Chains 2.49%
>
> 2. Drugstore Chains 4.76% 2. General Supermarket Chains 1.32%
>
> 3. General Supermarket Chains 2.91% 3. Mom-and-Pop Single Stores 0.48%

The activity-based analysis of costs highlights how the Mom-and-Pop Single Stores use a larger amount of Pharmahelp’s resources per revenue dollar than do the other two markets. The ratio of the operating costs to revenues across the three markets is:

General Supermarket Chains 1.59% ($58,997 ÷ $3,708,000)

Drugstore Chains 2.27% ($71,510 ÷ $3,150,000)

Mom-and-Pop Single Stores 8.61% ($170,573 ÷ $1,980,000)

This is a classic illustration of the maxim that “all revenue dollars are not created equal.” The analysis indicates that the Mom-and-Pop Single Stores are the least profitable market. Pharmahelp should work to increase profits in this market through (1) a possible surcharge, (2) decreasing the number of orders, (3) offering discounts for quantity purchases, etc.

Other issues for Pharmahelp to consider include:

a. *Choosing the appropriate cost drivers for each area.* The problem gives a cost driver for each chosen activity area. However, it is likely that over time further refinements in cost drivers would be necessary. For example, not all store deliveries are equally easy to make, depending on parking availability, accessibility of the storage/shelf space to the delivery point, etc. Similarly, not all cartons are equally easy to deliver––their weight, size, or likely breakage component are factors that can vary across carton types.

b. *Developing a reliable data base on the chosen cost drivers.* For some items, such as the number of orders and the number of line items, this information likely would be available in machine readable form at a high level of accuracy. Unless the delivery personnel have handheld computers that they use in a systematic way, estimates of shelf-stocking time are likely to be unreliable. Advances in information technology likely will reduce problems in this area over time.

c. *Deciding how to handle costs that may be common across several activities.* For example, (3) store delivery and (4) cartons shipped to stores have the common cost of the same trip. Some organizations may treat (3) as the primary activity and attribute only incremental costs to (4). Similarly, (1) order processing and (2) line item ordering may have common costs.

d. *Behavioral factors are likely to be a challenge to Flair.* He must now tell those salespeople who specialize in Mom-and-Pop accounts that they have been less profitable than previously thought.

Direct material and direct manufacturing labor are costs that can be easily traced to output, which in this case is the number of purses or backpacks produced.

Setup and shipping are both a function of the number of batches produced.

Design is related to the number of designs created for each product.

Plant utilities and administration result from general activity level in the plant. Thus, hours of production seems to be an appropriate cost driver.

5. Based on this analysis, more than 50% of product cost relates to direct material. Managers should determine whether the material costs can be reduced. Producing in small lots increases the setup and shipping costs. While both are relatively small components of product cost, management may want to evaluate ways to reduce the number of setups and the cost per setup. Of the indirect costs, the product- and facility-sustaining costs are the highest. Management should review the design process for cost savings and examine why it takes so long to produce purses relative to backpacks.

1c. The ABC system more accurately allocates costs because it identifies better cost drivers. The ABC system chooses cost drivers for overhead costs that have a cause-and-effect relationship between the cost drivers and the costs. Of course, Yu should continue to evaluate if better cost drivers can be found than the ones they have identified so far.

By implementing the ABC system, Yu can gain a more detailed understanding of costs and cost drivers. This is valuable information from a cost management perspective. The system can yield insight into the efficiencies with which various activities are performed. Yu can then examine if redundant activities can be eliminated. Yu can study trends and work toward improving the efficiency of the activities.

In addition, the ABC system will help Yu determine which programs are the most costly to operate. This will be useful in making long-run decisions as to which programs to offer or emphasize. The ABC system will also assist Yu in setting prices for the programs that more accurately reflect the costs of each program.

2. The concern with using costs per patient-year as the rule to allocate resources among its programs is that it emphasizes “input” to the exclusion of “outputs” or effectiveness of the programs. After-all, Yu’s goal is to cure patients while controlling costs, not minimize costs per-patient year. The problem, of course, is measuring outputs.

Unlike many manufacturing companies, where the outputs are obvious because they are tangible and measurable, the outputs of service organizations are more difficult to measure. Examples are “cured” patients as distinguished from “processed” or “discharged” patients, “educated” as distinguished from “partially educated” students, and so on.

4. Currently, Zarson’s only utilizes 80% of its available capacity. Managers should consider whether the excess capacity is sufficient to produce footballs. Other issues to consider include demand for the proposed product, the competition, capital investment needed to start and support this product line, and the availability of skilled and unskilled labor needed to manufacture footballs.

4. Although the excess capacity is currently costing Whitewater $40,000 annually, having excess capacity allows for the company to accept special orders if they are received, expand production of either of the existing models, or add a new product line in the future. Whitewater should consider if there is available labor and machine hours before increasing production to use the space, as well as demand for the product. Whitewater may also consider renting out the available space to a compatible outside user, with the option to take the space back if needed.

1. Plum Electronics should not emphasize the Maximum model and should not phase out the Mammoth model. Under activity-based costing, the Maximum model has an operating income percentage of less than 3%, while the Mammoth model has an operating income percentage of nearly 43%.

Cost driver rates for the various activities identified in the activity-based costing (ABC) system are as follows:

> Soldering $ 1,036,200 ÷ 1,570,000 = $ 0.66 per solder point
>
> Shipments 946,000 ÷ 20,000 = 47.30 per shipment
>
> Quality control 1,364,000 ÷ 77,500 = 17.60 per inspection
>
> Purchase orders 1,045,440 ÷ 190,080 = 5.50 per order
>
> Machine power 63,360 ÷ 192,000 = 0.33 per machine-hour
>
> Machine setups 825,000 ÷ 30,000 = 27.50 per setup

2. Plum’s simple costing system allocates all manufacturing overhead other than machine costs on the basis of machine-hours, an output unit-level cost driver. Consequently, the more machine-hours per unit that a product needs, the greater the manufacturing overhead allocated to it. Because Mammoth uses twice the number of machine-hours per unit compared to Maximum, a large amount of manufacturing overhead is allocated to Mammoth.

The ABC analysis recognizes several batch-level cost drivers such as purchase orders, shipments, and setups. Maximum uses these resources much more intensively than Mammoth. The ABC system recognizes Maximum’s use of these overhead resources. Consider, for example, purchase order costs. The simple system allocates these costs on the basis of machine-hours. As a result, each unit of Mammoth is allocated twice the purchase order costs of each unit of Maximum. The ABC system allocates $440,550 of purchase order costs to Mammoth (equal to $20.02 \[$440,550 ÷ 22,000\] per unit) and $604,890 of purchase order costs to Maximum (equal to $151.23 \[$604,890 ÷ 4,000\] per unit). Each unit of Maximum uses 8.31 ($151.23 ÷ $20.02) times the purchases order costs of each unit of Mammoth.

Recognizing Maximum’s more intensive use of manufacturing overhead results in Maximum showing a much lower profitability under the ABC system. By the same token, the ABC analysis shows that Mammoth is quite profitable. The simple costing system overcosted Mammoth and so made it appear less profitable.

3. Clark’s comments about ABC implementation are valid. When designing and implementing ABC systems, managers and management accountants need to trade off the costs of the system against its benefits. Adding more activities would make the system harder to understand and more costly to implement, but it would probably improve the accuracy of cost information, which, in turn, would help Plum make better decisions. Similarly, using inspection-hours and setup-hours as allocation bases would also probably lead to more accurate cost information, but it would increase measurement costs.

4. Activity-based management (ABM) is the use of information from activity-based costing to make improvements in a firm. For example, a firm could revise product prices on the basis of revised cost information. For the long term, activity-based costing can assist management in making decisions regarding the viability of product lines, distribution channels, marketing strategies, etc. ABM highlights possible improvements, including reduction or elimination of non-value-added activities, selecting lower cost activities, sharing activities with other products, and eliminating waste. ABM is an integrated approach that focuses management’s attention on activities with the ultimate aim of continuous improvement. As a whole-company philosophy, ABM focuses on strategic, as well as tactical and operational activities of the company.

5. Incorrect reporting of ABC costs with the goal of retaining both the Mammoth and Maximum product lines is unethical. In assessing the situation, the specific “Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants” that the management accountant should consider are listed below.

*Competence*

Clear reports using relevant and reliable information should be prepared. Preparing reports on the basis of incorrect costs in order to retain product lines violates competence standards. It is unethical for Jacobs to change the ABC system with the specific goal of reporting different product cost numbers that Clark favors.

*Integrity*

The management accountant has a responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest and advise all appropriate parties of any potential conflict. Jacobs may be tempted to change the product cost numbers to please Clark, the division president. This action, however, would violate the responsibility for integrity. The Standards of Ethical Conduct require the management accountant to communicate favorable as well as unfavorable information.

*Credibility*

The management accountant’s standards of ethical conduct require that information should be fairly and objectively communicated and that all relevant information should be disclosed. From a management accountant’s standpoint, adjusting the product cost numbers to make both the Mammoth and Maximum lines look profitable would violate the standard of objectivity.

Jacobs should indicate to Clark that the product cost calculations are, indeed, appropriate. If Clark still insists on modifying the product cost numbers, Jacobs should raise the matter with one of Clark’s superiors. If, after taking all these steps, there is continued pressure to modify product cost numbers, Jacobs should consider resigning from the company rather than engage in unethical behavior.

Comparing product line income statements in requirements 1 and 2, it appears that books are much more profitable and café loses a lot more money under the ABC system compared to the simple system. The reason is that books use far fewer S,G, & A resources relative to its merchandise costs, and café uses far greater S, G, & A resources relative to its merchandise costs.

***Re: Costing System***

The current accounting system allocates indirect costs (S,G, & A) to product lines based on the Cost of Merchandise sold. Using this method, the S, G, & A costs are assigned 54%, 35%, 11%, to the Books, CDs, and Café product lines, respectively.

I recommend that the organization switch to an activity-based costing (ABC) method. With ABC, the product lines are assigned indirect costs based on their consumption of the activities that give rise to the costs. An ABC analysis reveals that the Café consumes considerably more than 11% of indirect costs. Instead, the café generally requires 25–35% of the purchasing, receiving, and stocking activity and 60% of the customer support.

The current accounting technique masks the losses being produced by the café because it assumes all indirect costs are driven by the dollar amount of merchandise sold. By adopting ABC, management can evaluate the costs of operating the three product lines and make more informed pricing and product mix decisions. For example, management may want to consider increasing prices of the food and drinks served in the café. Before deciding whether to increase prices or to close the café, management must consider the beneficial effect that having a cafe has on the other product lines.

An ABC analysis can also help Main Street Books and Café manage its costs by reducing the number of activities that each product line demands and by reducing the cost of each activity. These actions will improve the profitability of each product line. ABC analysis can also be used to plan and manage the various activities.
