> The discussion of the different levels of variance analysis has been streamlined, making for a more readable text. The links between the production variances and the sales-volume variances have been emphasized and tightened. Problem material in this chapter has been heavily revised, with a number of new problems and exercises introduced.

1.  **CHAPTER SYNOPSIS**

> This chapter introduces the concept of flexible budgets and variances. Direct-cost variances—direct materials price and efficiency variances and direct labor price and efficiency variances are calculated and analyzed. In addition, managerial use of variances and benchmarking are discussed.

**III. Points of Emphasis**

1.  Students will find this material difficult. It is not enough to lecture on the material, variance analysis must be demonstrated and the students must be engaged to the point of calculating variances on their own. It is helpful to walk through the variance exhibits given in the chapter. Also, Exhibit 7–1 can be a useful template for the students in performing variance analysis. The comprehensive variance analysis problems at the end of the chapter are good to reinforce these concepts.

2.  Be certain the students understand the interrelationships of efficiency and effectiveness and how easy it may become to emphasize one to the detriment of the other. In addition, emphasize the other uses of variance analysis—organizational learning and continuous improvement. Students can tolerate variance analysis much more readily if they perceive their usefulness.

> Teaching Point. At this point it is good to emphasize two points about variances. First, variance analysis is not simple. In order to fully understand variance analysis, one needs to understand the terminology. However, variance analysis is very valuable in that it can provide much useful information about how the company is operating. Second, the variances illustrated in this chapter (and others) are only the beginning of variance analysis. Anytime there are budgeted and actual amounts, a variance can be calculated.

1.  A flexible budget adjusts the master budget using actual output to recalculate revenue and variable costs for the budget period. This allows management to compare actual results with budgeted results for that activity level. The three-step process for developing the flexible budget is as follows:

-   Identify the actual output quantity.

-   Calculate flexible budget revenues (budgeted selling price × actual quantity).

-   Calculate flexible budget costs (budgeted per-unit variable cost × actual quantity plus fixed costs).

1.  The **sales-volume variance** is the difference between the flexible budget (at actual output) and the corresponding static budget amount.

2.  The **flexible-budget variance** is the difference between actual revenues or costs and the corresponding flexible budget amounts.

3.  The flexible-budget variance for revenues is called the **selling-price variance** as it arises only from the difference between the actual selling price and the budgeted selling price.

> 4.1 A **standard** is a carefully determined price, cost, or quantity that is used as a benchmark for judging performance. It is usually expressed on a per-unit basis.

-   A **standard input** is a quantity of input such as 2 pounds of raw material or one direct labor hour for each completed unit.

<!-- -->

-   A **standard price** is the price a company expects to pay for a unit of input, such as $10 per direct labor hour.

-   A **standard cost** is the cost to the company of a unit of output, such as direct material cost of a completed unit.

> Teaching point. Involve the students in a discussion of standards. A good example of a standard is the speed limits on the interstate highway. There is both a minimum and a maximum standard, expressed as minimum speed and the speed limit.
>
> 4.2 A standard can be thought of as a budget for one unit of product.
>
> 4.3 Standards, as used in variance analysis, have two advantages:

-   They seek to exclude past efficiencies.

-   They take into account changes expected to occur in the budget period.

> 4.4 Standards also simplify product costing, enabling the company to cost a product immediately upon its completion.

> 5.1 The total variance for direct materials and direct labor can be subdivided into two components—price and efficiency. These two variances help explain the two reasons that the actual cost differs from the budgeted numbers.
>
> Teaching point. Sometimes these variances go by other names. The direct-material variances may be called price and usage variances. The direct-labor variances may be called rate and efficiency variances. This should be pointed out to the students. As the variance for both direct cost categories are calculated in a similar manner, it is less confusing to the student to use the consistent terminology of price and efficiency.

> Teaching point. At this point it is important to demonstrate the calculation of the variances and get the students engaged in calculating them on their own.
>
> 5.4 In a standard cost system, inputs are recorded at standard. The impact of this is that the variances are isolated and recorded in the accounting system. In addition to simplifying product costing, this procedure draws attention to the variances. What becomes visible (variances) is more likely to receive management attention.
>
> Teaching point. It is a good idea to walk the students through the journal entries for a standard costing system. This demonstrates the effects of recording inputs at standard cost. It also demonstrates drawing attention to the variances.

| Understand how managers use variances                  
                                                         
 … managers use variances to improve future performance  |
|                                                        |

> 6.1 Managers use variances in three ways:

-   To evaluate performance after decisions are implemented

-   To trigger organizational learning

-   To make continuous improvements

> 6.2 Variances should not be interpreted in isolation. The cause of a variance in one part of the value chain may be related to decisions made in another.
>
> Teaching point. Discuss possible causes of variances and how one may affect another. For example, a favorable materials price variance may give rise to an unfavorable efficiency variance if the cheaper material is of lower quality. This may also result in an unfavorable labor efficiency variance as the workers find the lower-quality material more difficult to work with.
>
> Also, a favorable direct materials efficiency variance may be due to an experienced workforce. However, experienced workers are paid more and there may be an unfavorable direct labor price variance as a result. The opposite can be true with inexperienced workers.
>
> 6.3 Variances should be investigated when they are considered material. Frequently, this may be a subjective judgment or rule of thumb. It is equally important to investigate favorable variances as unfavorable. For example, all variances resulting from defective raw materials might be investigated, regardless of amount.
>
> 6.4 Managerial performance evaluation occurs on two dimensions—effectiveness and efficiency.

-   **Effectiveness** is the degree to which a predetermined objective or target is met.

-   **Efficiency** is the relative amount of inputs used to achieve a given output level.

> Teaching point. A manager of a restaurant once persuaded a group to have their annual banquet in his facility. However, in order to do so, he had to provide them with a degree of privacy. So he rented a portable partition to provide this privacy. Unfortunately, the cost of renting the partition almost equaled the revenue generated from the banquet (not even considering food and labor costs). The manager was effective in generating revenues, but he did not do it efficiently.
>
> 6.5 The second use of variances is organizational learning. Managers need to understand why variances arise, learn from them, and improve future performance.
>
> 6.6 Finally, variances are used to create a cycle of continuous improvement by identifying causes of the variances, initiating corrective actions, and evaluating the results of those actions.
>
> 6.7 Most companies utilize a combination of financial and nonfinancial measures for planning and control. Focusing on one or the other can result in an undue emphasis on that type of measure.

> 7.1 **Benchmarking** is the continuous process of comparing the levels of performance in producing products and services and executing activities against the best levels of performance in competing companies or in companies having similar processes.
>
> 7.2 Managers will know the company will be competitive if it can attain the standards set by benchmarking.
>
> Teaching point. It may be difficult for a company to attain sufficient information from competitors to set a valid benchmark. The company should not hesitate to look outside the industry. For example, if they want to benchmark their accounts receivable function, find a company who is not a competitor and benchmark against that company. Another approach would be to benchmark against the best within the company. One hotel chain selected its own properties as benchmark properties. The downtown property may have been the benchmark for customer service, for example.
