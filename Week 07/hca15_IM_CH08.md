1.  **CHAPTER SYNOPSIS**

> The previous chapter focused on analysis of direct manufacturing costs. This chapter moves into planning and variance analysis of variable and fixed manufacturing overhead. Development of budgeted overhead cost rates is covered. Variable overhead spending and efficiency variance are presented, followed by fixed overhead spending and production-volume variances. A 4-way variance analysis is presented, along with the application of variance analysis in nonmanufacturing and service sectors. Finally, application of variance analysis in an ABC system is presented.

**III. Points of Emphasis**

1.  Developing budgeted variable overhead cost rates is critical to effectively managing overhead and conducting performance evaluation. Emphasize to the students that a “good” overhead rate using a valid cost driver is the foundation of effective overhead cost allocation.

2.  Make sure the students understand the reasons and the potential problems associated with expressing fixed costs on a per-unit basis. Students often fall into the trap of using the same fixed cost per unit when volume changes.

3.  Presentation of the 4-way, 3-way, 2-way, and 1-way variance analysis can help the students see how these variances are related to one another. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate that different levels of management need different levels of detail in the reporting system.

1.  Managing overhead costs is challenging. Managers must understand the behavior of overhead costs, plan for them, perform variance analysis, and act upon the results.

2.  In planning **variable overhead costs,** managers must focus attention on activities that create a superior product or service and eliminate activities that do not add value.

3.  Examining how each item of variable overhead relates to delivering a superior product or service is part of this process.

4.  Effective planning for **fixed overhead costs** is similar to planning for variable overhead costs—focusing on eliminating the non-value-added costs.

5.  An additional strategic issue for managers in fixed costs is choosing the appropriate level of capacity that will benefit the company in the long run.

6.  Timing is an important issue in this planning. By the beginning of the budget period most decisions regarding fixed costs will have been made. With variable costs, day-to-day operating decisions affect the level of variable costs incurred in the period.

> Teaching point. This is a good time to emphasize that fixed costs provide capacity. As such, the level of fixed costs must be determined well in advance of the budget period and those costs are frequently locked in for an extended time period. Thus this decision-making process can have a long-term effect on company profitability. Check recent business news articles for companies that have downsized, taking large losses while reducing capacity.

> 2.1 **Standard costing** is a costing system that traces direct costs to output by multiplying standard prices or rates of inputs allowed for actual outputs produced and allocates overhead costs based on standard overhead cost rates times the standard quantities of the allocation bases allowed for the actual outputs produced.

> Teaching point. This process will become much clearer to the student if an example is used to work through the process of developing these cost rates. The Webb Company example in the text can be utilized.
>
> **Step 1:** **Choose the Period to Be Used for the Budget.** Normally companies will use a 12-month period for budgeting, but a shorter time frame may be appropriate in given situations.
>
> **Step 2:** **Select the Cost-Allocation Bases to Use in Allocating Variable Overhead Costs to Output Produced.** In selecting the cost-allocation bases, management is seeking a cause-and-effect relationship between the cost and the base, or cost driver.
>
> **Step 3:** **Identify the Variable Overhead Costs Associated with Each Cost-Allocation Base.**
>
> Teaching point. Identifying the cost-allocation bases and the costs associated with those bases are not necessarily sequential steps. The two frequently interact with each other as additional costs or drivers are identified and defined. The number of allocation bases and cost pools will vary depending on the system utilized by the company. With an activity-based system, there will be several drivers and cost pools.
>
> **Step 4:** **Compute the Rate per Unit of Each Cost-Allocation Base Used to Allocate Variable Overhead Costs to Output Produced.**
>
> 2.3 Fixed overhead costs are, by definition, a lump sum of costs that remain unchanged in total for a given period despite wide changes in the level of activity.
>
> 2.4 These costs are fixed in the sense that they do not automatically increase or decrease with the level of activity within the relevant range.
>
> Teaching point. Discuss unitized fixed costs. Emphasize that fixed costs are expressed on a per-unit basis to facilitate assigning a unit cost to the product or service. Illustrate that a change in the level of activity changes the per-unit cost of the fixed amount, not the total fixed cost.
>
> 2.5 As with variable costs, there is a four-step procedure for developing the budget fixed overhead rate.
>
> **Step 1:** **Choose the Period to Use for the Budget.** As with variable costs, this budget period is usually 12 months.
>
> **Step 2:** **Select the Cost-Allocation Bases to Use in Allocating Fixed Overhead Costs to Output Produced.** The cost driver, or allocation base, is also referred to as the **denominator level** as it is the denominator in the fixed overhead rate computation.
>
> Teaching point. Due to the nature of fixed costs it is not always feasible or possible to find a cause-and-effect relationship between the level of activity and the costs incurred. Therefore, even in a well-developed activity-based costing system, a company is likely to have an element of fixed overhead that is allocated under some “generic” allocation base such as machine hours or direct labor hours.

1.  The **variable overhead flexible-budget variance** measures the difference between actual variable overhead costs incurred and the flexible-budget overhead amounts.

> Variable overhead Actual costs Flexible-budget
>
> flexible-budget variance = incurred – amount

1.  This variance reveals how much variable overhead costs differed from the flexible budget amount. However, it does little to explain why this difference occurred. To learn why the variance arose, it needs to be divided into two components—variable overhead efficiency variance and the variable overhead spending variance.

> Teaching point. Demonstrating the variable overhead variances as you explain each one will help the students grasp the differences and meaning of each. It will also be helpful to explain what each variance represents using nonaccounting language.

1.  The **variable overhead efficiency variance** measures the difference between actual quantities of the cost-allocation base used and budgeted quantities of the cost-allocation base that should have been used to produce actual output.

> Variable overhead efficiency variance =
>
> (Actual Qty of Allocation Base – Standard Qty of Allocation Base allowed for actual output) × Standard Price
>
> Teaching point. The variable overhead efficiency variance measures the efficiency with which the cost-allocation base is used. For example, if the allocation base is direct labor hours and there is an unfavorable direct labor efficiency variance, the variable overhead efficiency variance will also be unfavorable.

1.  The **variable overhead spending variance** is the difference between actual variable overhead costs per unit of the cost-allocation base and budgeted variable overhead cost per unit of the cost-allocation base. This variance arises simply because the items that make up variable overhead cost more or less than was budgeted.

> Variable overhead spending variance =
>
> (Actual Price of Allocation Base – Standard Price of Allocation Base) × Actual Qty
>
> (Exhibit 8-4 displays variable overhead efficiency and spending variance calculations.)

1.  In recording the journal entries for variable overhead, the variances are included, so that the costs of the products or services are recorded at standard. Note that an unfavorable variance will be recorded as a debit and a favorable variance as a credit.

> Teaching point. In illustrating the computation of these variances it will reinforce the concept for the students if you conclude by illustrating the journal entries.

> 4.4 Because there is no fixed overhead efficiency variance, the **fixed overhead spending variance** and the fixed overhead flexible-budget variance are the same.
>
> Fixed overhead Actual costs Flexible-budget
>
> spending variance = incurred – amount
>
> 4.5 This variance arises because the items making up fixed overhead cost (such as insurance) were more or less than was budgeted.
>
> 4.6 The **production-volume variance** (also known as the **denominator-level variance**) arises only for fixed costs. This variance is the difference between budgeted fixed overhead and fixed overhead allocated based on the number of units actually produced.
>
> Production Budgeted Fixed overhead allocated
>
> volume variance = fixed overhead – for actual output units produced
>
> 4.7 The production-volume variance is an indicator of the use of capacity. If the company exceeded planned capacity, the variance is favorable, as fixed overhead is divided among a greater number of units. If the company fell short of planned capacity, the variance is unfavorable, as there was unused capacity. It should be noted that this variance is directly influenced by the **production-denominator level,** or definition of capacity for determining the application rate.
>
> 4.8 Another way to view the production-volume variance is that a favorable variance indicates that overhead was overallocated; if unfavorable, overhead is underallocated.

>
> 4.10 At the end of the accounting period, any balance in the variable or fixed overhead variance accounts must be dealt with. If the amount is deemed to be immaterial, these balances may be written off directly to Cost of Goods Sold. If they are material, the balances should be allocated among Work-in-Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold.

> 5.1 As we have seen, the calculation of variances for variable overhead and fixed overhead differ.

-   Variable manufacturing overhead has no production-volume variance.

-   Fixed manufacturing overhead has no efficiency variance.

> (Exhibit 8-4 illustrates an integrated summary of the variable and fixed overhead variances.)
>
> 5.2 When all of the overhead variances are presented together, it is referred to as a **4-variance analysis.** Although this presents the same information that calculation of the individual variances gives, this does so in a unified presentation that also indicates that the fixed overhead efficiency and variable overhead production-volume variance never exist.
>
> 5.3 Not all managers need the detail found in the 4-variance model. Managers of smaller businesses may understand their operations better from personal observation and nonfinancial measures. They may find that a **3-variance analysis** provides an acceptable level of detail. This is obtained by combining the spending variances for variable and fixed overhead into a *single overhead spending variance* and presenting the variable overhead efficiency and fixed overhead production-volume variances.
>
> 5.4 In other situations, it may be desirable to present even less detail. This can be accomplished through a **2-variance analysis.** This analysis combines the overhead spending variance and the variable overhead efficiency variance into a single *flexible-budget variance* along with the fixed overhead production-volume variance.
>
> 5.5 Finally, the flexible-budget variance and the fixed overhead production-volume variance can be combined into a **1-variance analysis** reflecting a *total overhead variance.* This is the total underapplied or overapplied overhead costs.
>
> Teaching point. Having the students work through the process of calculating variances and then presenting them in a 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1-variance analysis will reinforce the concepts covered in this chapter and help them to relate overhead variance analysis to the bigger picture.
>
> 5.6 All the variances discussed in this chapter are examples of financial performance measures. Managers will also find nonfinancial performance measures to be helpful.
>
> 5.7 Nonmanufacturing and service sector companies can benefit from the use of variance analysis. Many of these companies have a high level of fixed costs and the key to their profitability is the effective use of capacity.
