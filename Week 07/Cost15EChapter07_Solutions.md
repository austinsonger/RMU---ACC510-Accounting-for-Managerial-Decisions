CHAPTER 7

FLEXIBLE BUDGETS, DIRECT-COST VARIANCES,

AND MANAGEMENT CONTROL

**7-1** *Management by exception* is the practice of concentrating on areas not operating as expected and giving less attention to areas operating as expected. Variance analysis helps managers identify areas not operating as expected. The larger the variance, the more likely an area is not operating as expected.

1.  Two sources of information about budgeted amounts are (a) past amounts and
    (b) detailed engineering studies.

2.  A *favorable variance*––denoted F––is a variance that has the effect of increasing operating income relative to the budgeted amount. An *unfavorable variance*––denoted U––is a variance that has the effect of decreasing operating income relative to the budgeted amount.

3.  The key difference is the output level used to set the budget. A *static budget* is based on the level of output planned at the *start of the budget period*. A *flexible budget* is developed using budgeted revenues or cost amounts based on the actual output level in the budget period. The actual level of output is not known until the *end of the budget period*.

**7-5** A flexible-budget analysis enables a manager to distinguish how much of the difference between an actual result and a budgeted amount is due to (a) the difference between actual and budgeted output levels, and (b) the difference between actual and budgeted selling prices, variable costs, and fixed costs.

**7-6** The steps in developing a flexible budget are:

> Step 1: Identify the actual quantity of output.
>
> Step 2: Calculate the flexible budget for revenues based on budgeted selling price and actual quantity of output.
>
> Step 3: Calculate the flexible budget for costs based on budgeted variable cost per output unit, actual quantity of output, and budgeted fixed costs.

**7-7** Four reasons for using standard costs are

> (i) cost management,
>
> (ii) pricing decisions,
>
> (iii) budgetary planning and control, and
>
> (iv) financial statement preparation.

**7-8** A manager should subdivide the flexible-budget variance for direct materials into a price variance (that reflects the difference between actual and budgeted prices of direct materials) and an efficiency variance (that reflects the difference between the actual and budgeted quantities of direct materials used to produce actual output). The individual causes of these variances can then be investigated, recognizing possible interdependencies across these individual causes.

**7-9** Possible causes of a favorable direct materials price variance are

-   purchasing officer negotiated more skillfully than was planned in the budget.

-   purchasing manager bought in larger lot sizes than budgeted, thus obtaining quantity discounts.

-   materials prices decreased unexpectedly due to, say, industry oversupply.

-   budgeted purchase prices were set without careful analysis of the market.

-   purchasing manager received unfavorable terms on nonpurchase price factors (such as lower quality materials).

**7-10** Some possible reasons for an unfavorable direct manufacturing labor efficiency variance are the hiring and use of underskilled workers; inefficient scheduling of work so that the workforce was not optimally occupied; poor maintenance of machines resulting in a high proportion of non-value-added labor; unrealistic time standards. Each of these factors would result in actual direct manufacturing labor-hours being higher than indicated by the standard work rate.

**7-11** Variance analysis, by providing information about actual performance relative to standards, can form the basis of continuous operational improvement. The underlying causes of unfavorable variances are identified and corrective action taken where possible. Favorable variances can also provide information if the organization can identify why a favorable variance occurred. Steps can often be taken to replicate those conditions more often. As the easier changes are made, and perhaps some standards tightened, the harder issues will be revealed for the organization to act on—this is continuous improvement.

**7-12** An individual business function, such as production, is interdependent with other business functions. Factors outside of production can explain why variances arise in the production area. For example:

-   Poor design of products or processes can lead to a sizable number of defects.

-   Marketing personnel making promises for delivery times that require a large number of rush orders can create production-scheduling difficulties.

-   Purchase of poor-quality materials by the purchasing manager can result in defects and waste.

    1.  The plant supervisor likely has good grounds for complaint if the plant accountant puts excessive emphasis on using variances to pin blame. The key value of variances is to help understand why actual results differ from budgeted amounts and then to use that knowledge to promote learning and continuous improvement.

    2.  The sales-volume variance can be decomposed into two parts: a market-share variance that reflects the difference in budgeted contribution margin due to the actual market share being different from the budgeted share; and a market-size variance, which captures the impact of actual size of the market as a while differing from the budgeted market size.

    3.  Evidence on the costs of other companies is one input managers can use in setting the performance measure for next year. However, caution should be taken before choosing such an amount as next year's performance measure. It is important to understand why cost differences across companies exist and whether these differences can be eliminated. It is also important to examine when planned changes (in, say, technology) next year make even the current low-cost producer not a demanding enough hurdle.

The total static-budget variance in operating income is $20,000 U. There is both an unfavorable total flexible-budget variance ($12,800) and an unfavorable sales-volume variance ($7,200).

The unfavorable sales-volume variance arises solely because actual units manufactured and sold were 200 less than the budgeted 3,000 units. The unfavorable flexible-budget variance of $12,800 in operating income is due primarily to the $8 increase in unit variable costs. This increase in unit variable costs is only partially offset by the $2 increase in unit selling price and the $4,000 decrease in fixed costs.

**7-17** (15 min.) **Flexible budget.**

The existing performance report is a Level 1 analysis, based on a static budget. It makes no adjustment for changes in output levels. The budgeted output level is 10,000 units––direct materials of $400,000 in the static budget ÷ budgeted direct materials cost per attaché case of $40.

The following is a Level 2 analysis that presents a flexible-budget variance and a sales-volume variance of each direct cost category.

The Level 1 analysis shows total direct costs have a $48,000 favorable variance. However, the Level 2 analysis reveals that this favorable variance is due to the reduction in output of 1,200 units from the budgeted 10,000 units. Once this reduction in output is taken into account (via a flexible budget), the flexible-budget variance shows each direct cost category to have an unfavorable variance indicating less efficient use of each direct cost item than was budgeted, or the use of more costly direct cost items than was budgeted, or both.

Each direct cost category has an actual unit variable cost that exceeds its budgeted unit cost:

3. Level 2 analysis breaks down the static-budget variance into a flexible-budget variance and a sales-volume variance. The primary reason for the static-budget variance being unfavorable ($17,000 U) is the reduction in unit volume from the budgeted 15,000 to an actual 12,000. One explanation for this reduction is the increase in selling price from a budgeted $20 to an actual $21. Operating management was able to reduce variable costs by $12,000 relative to the flexible budget. This reduction could be a sign of efficient management. Alternatively, it could be due to using lower quality materials (which in turn adversely affected unit volume).

<sup>b</sup> 130,000 × $2.00 = $260,000; $240,000 120,000 = $2.00

2. Actual selling price: $715,000 ÷ 130,000 = $5.50

Budgeted selling price: 420,000 ÷ 120,000 = $3.50

Actual variable cost per unit: 515,000 ÷ 130,000 = $3.96

Budgeted variable cost per unit: 240,000 ÷ 120,000 = $2.00

3. A zero total static-budget variance may be due to offsetting total flexible-budget and total sales-volume variances. In this case, these two variances exactly offset each other:

Total flexible-budget variance $15,000 Unfavorable

Total sales-volume variance $15,000 Favorable

A closer look at the variance components reveals some major deviations from plan. Actual variable costs increased from $2.00 to $3.96, causing an unfavorable flexible-budget variable cost variance of $255,000. Such an increase could be a result of, for example, a jump in direct material prices. Clarkson was able to pass most of the increase in costs onto their customers—actual selling price increased by 57% \[($5.50 – $3.50)$3.50\], bringing about an offsetting favorable flexible-budget revenue variance in the amount of $260,000. An increase in the actual number of units sold also contributed to more favorable results. The company should examine why the units sold increased despite an increase in direct material prices. For example, Clarkson’s customers may have stocked up, anticipating future increases in direct material prices. Alternatively, Clarkson’s selling price increases may have been lower than competitors’ price increases. Understanding the reasons why actual results differ from budgeted amounts can help Clarkson better manage its costs and pricing decisions in the future. The important lesson learned here is that a superficial examination of summary level data (Levels 0 and 1) may be insufficient. It is imperative to scrutinize data at a more detailed level (Level 2). Had Clarkson not been able to pass costs on to customers, losses would have been considerable.

$63,000 U

Static-budget variance

<sup>a</sup> Budgeted selling price = $1,976,500 ÷ 335,000 lbs = $5.90 per lb.

Flexible-budget revenues = $5.90 per lb. × 350,000 lbs. = $2,065,000

<sup>b</sup> Budgeted variable mfg. cost per unit = $1,038,500 ÷ 335,000 lbs. = $3.10

Flexible-budget variable mfg. costs = $3.10 per lb. × 350,000 lbs. = $1,085,000

3. The selling price variance, caused solely by the difference in actual and budgeted selling price, is the flexible-budget variance in revenues = $52,500 U.

4. The flexible-budget variances show that for the actual sales volume of 350,000 pounds, selling prices were lower and costs per pound were higher. The favorable sales volume variance in revenues (because more pounds of ice cream were sold than budgeted) helped offset the unfavorable variable cost variance and shored up the results in June 2014. Adler should be more concerned because the static-budget variance in contribution margin of $63,000 U is actually made up of a favorable sales-volume variance in contribution margin of $42,000, an unfavorable selling-price variance of $52,500 and an unfavorable variable manufacturing costs variance of $52,500. Adler should analyze why each of these variances occurred and the relationships among them. Could the efficiency of variable manufacturing costs be improved? The sales volume appears to have increased due to the lower average selling price per pound.

<sup>c</sup> 60,800 × 0.25 × $0.89 = $13,528

3. The favorable flexible-budget variance of $408 has two offsetting components:

> (a) favorable price variance of $1,120––reflects the $0.82 actual purchase cost being lower than the $0.89 budgeted purchase cost per pound.
>
> (b) unfavorable efficiency variance of $712––reflects the actual materials yield of 3.80 scones per pound of pumpkin (60,800 ÷ 16,000 = 3.80) being less than the budgeted yield of 4.00 (60,000 ÷ 15,000 = 4.00). The company used more pumpkins (materials) to make the scones than was budgeted.

One explanation may be that Peterson purchased lower quality pumpkins at a lower cost per pound.

3. Efficiencies have improved in the direction indicated by the production manager—but, it is unclear whether they are a trend or a one-time occurrence. Also, overall, variances are still 7.8 percent of flexible input budget. SallyMay should continue to use the new material, especially in light of its superior quality and feel, but it may want to keep the following points in mind:

-   The new material costs substantially more than the old ($1.95 in 2013 and $1.852 in 2014 versus $1.70 per meter). Its price is unlikely to come down even more within the coming year. Standard material price should be reexamined and possibly changed.

-   SallyMay should continue to work to reduce direct materials and direct manufacturing labor content. The reductions from May 2013 to May 2014 are a good development and should be encouraged.

3. Some students’ comments will be immersed in conjecture about higher prices for materials, better quality materials, higher-grade labor, better efficiency in use of materials, and so forth. A possibility is that approximately the same labor force, paid somewhat more, is taking slightly less time with better materials and causing less waste and spoilage.

A key point in this problem is that all of these efficiency variances are likely to be insignificant. They are so small as to be nearly meaningless. Fluctuations about standards are bound to occur in a random fashion. Practically, from a control viewpoint, a standard is a band or range of acceptable performance rather than a single-figure measure.

1.  The purchasing point is where responsibility for price variances is found most often. The production point is where responsibility for efficiency variances is found most often. The Schuyler Corporation may calculate variances at different points in time to tie in with these different responsibility areas.

The unfavorable materials price variance may be unrelated to the favorable materials efficiency variance. For example, (a) the purchasing officer may be less skillful than assumed in the budget, or (b) there was an unexpected increase in materials price per square yard due to reduced competition. Similarly, the favorable materials efficiency variance may be unrelated to the unfavorable materials price variance. For example, (a) the production manager may have been able to employ higher-skilled workers, or (b) the budgeted materials standards were set too loosely. It is also possible that the two variances are interrelated. The higher materials input price may be due to higher-quality materials being purchased. Less material was used than budgeted due to the high quality of the materials.

The favorable labor price variance may be due to, say, (a) a reduction in labor rates due to a recession, or (b) the standard being set without detailed analysis of labor compensation. The favorable labor efficiency variance may be due to, say, (a) more efficient workers being employed, (b) a redesign in the plant enabling labor to be more productive, or (c) the use of higher quality materials.

The T-account entries related to direct manufacturing labor are the same as in requirement 1. The difference between standard costing and normal costing for direct cost items is:

|              |                    |                  |
|--------------|--------------------|------------------|
|              | **Standard Costs** | **Normal Costs** |
| Direct Costs | Standard price(s)  
                                    
                × Standard input    
                                    
                allowed for actual  
                                    
                outputs achieved    | Actual price(s)  
                                                       
                                     × Actual input    |

These journal entries differ from the *normal costing* entries because Work-in-Process Control is no longer carried at “actual” costs. Furthermore, Direct Materials Control is carried at standard unit prices rather than actual unit prices. Finally, variances appear for direct materials and direct manufacturing labor under *standard costing* but not under *normal costing*.

3. Using an objective, external benchmark, like that of a competitor, will preempt the possibility of any one plant feeling that the other is being favored. That this competitor, Land Art, is successful will also put positive pressure on the two plants to improve (note that all variances are unfavorable). Issues that Topiary should keep in mind include the following:

-   Ensure that Land Art is indeed the best and most relevant standard (for example, is there another competitor in the marketplace which should be considered?).

-   Ensure that the data is reliable.

-   Ensure that Land Art is similar enough to use as a standard (if Land Art has a different business model, for example, it may be following a strategy of lowering costs that Topiary may not want to emulate because Topiary is trying to differentiate its products).

4. Effectiveness refers to the degree to which a predetermined objective is accomplished. One objective of StuFi professional labor is to maximize loan-based revenue (0.8% of loan amount × number of loans). The professional staff has increased the number of loans from a budgeted 8,200 to 10,250, a significant increase. In addition, the average loan amount increased from a budgeted $145,000 to $162,000. The result is an increase in revenue from the budgeted $9,512,000 to actual $13,284,000.

With both a higher number of loans and a higher average amount per loan, there was an increase in the effectiveness of professional labor in the third quarter of 2014.

1.  In addition to understanding the variances computed above, Marcus should attempt to keep track of the number of cars worked on by each employee, as well as the number of hours actually spent on each car. In addition, Marcus should look at the prices charged for detailing, in relation to the hours spent on each job. It should also be considered whether the experienced worker should be asked to take less time per car, given his prior years at work and the fact that he is paid twice the wage rate of the less-experienced employees.

**7-31** (60 min.) **Comprehensive variance analysis, responsibility issues.**

1a. Actual selling price = $79.00

Budgeted selling price = $78.00

Actual sales volume = 7,300 units

Selling price variance = (Actual sales price − Budgeted sales price) × Actual sales volume

= ($79 − $78) × 7,300 = $7,300 Favorable

2. Possible explanations for the price variances are

1.  unexpected outcomes from purchasing and labor negotiations during the year.

2.  higher quality of frames and/or lower quality of lenses purchased.

3.  standards set incorrectly at the start of the year.

Possible explanations for the uniformly unfavorable efficiency variances are

1.  substantially higher usage of lenses due to poor-quality lenses purchased at lower price.

2.  lesser trained workers hired at lower rates result in higher materials usage (for both frames and lenses), as well as lower levels of labor efficiency.

3.  standards set incorrectly at the start of the year.

2. If union organizers are targeting our plant, it could suggest employee dissatisfaction with our wage and benefits policies. During this time of targeting, we might expect employees to work more slowly, and they may be less careful with the materials that they are using. These tactics might be seen as helpful in either organizing the union or in receiving increases in wages and/or benefits. We should expect unfavorable efficiency variances for both wages and materials. We may see an unfavorable wage variance, if we need to pay overtime due to work slowdowns. We do, in fact, see a substantial unfavorable materials quantity variance, representing a serious overuse of materials. While we may not expect each bottle to use exactly 15 oz. of materials, we do expect the shrinkage to be much less than this. Similarly, we see well over double the number of hours used relative to what we expect to make and fill this number of bottles. They are able to produce just under 15 bottles per hour, instead of the standard 30 bottles per hour. It is plausible that this waste and inefficiency are either caused by, or are reflective of, the reasons behind the attempt to organize the union at this plant.

1.  The favorable price variance is due to the $1 difference ($18 – $17) between the standard price based on the previous suppliers and the actual price paid through the online marketplace. The unfavorable efficiency variance could be due to several factors including inexperienced workers and machine malfunctions. But the likely cause here is that the lower-priced titanium was lower quality or less refined, which led to more waste. The labor efficiency variance could be affected if the lower quality titanium caused the workers to use more time.

2.  Switching suppliers was not a good idea. The $5,200 savings in the cost of titanium was outweighed by the $27,000 extra material usage. In addition, the $27,000 U efficiency variance does not recognize the total impact of the lower quality titanium because, of the 5,200 pounds purchased, only 4,700 pounds were used. If the quantity of materials used in production is relatively the same, Best Bikes could expect the remaining 500 lbs to produce approximately 40 more units. At standard, 40 more units should take 40 × 8 = 320 lbs. There could be an additional unfavorable efficiency variance of

1.  The purchasing manager’s performance evaluation should not be based solely on the price variance. The short-run reduction in purchase costs was more than offset by higher usage rates. His evaluation should be based on the total costs of the company as a whole. In addition, the production manager’s performance evaluation should not be based solely on the efficiency variances. In this case, the production manager was not responsible for the purchase of the lower-quality titanium, which led to the unfavorable efficiency scores. In general, it is important for Johnson to understand that not all favorable material price

> variances are “good news” because of the negative effects that can arise in the production process from the purchase of inferior inputs. They can lead to unfavorable efficiency variances for both materials and labor. Johnson should also that understand efficiency variances may arise for many different reasons and she needs to know these reasons before evaluating performance.

1.  Variances should be used to help Best Bikes understand what led to the current set of financial results, as well as how to perform better in the future. They are a way to facilitate the continuous improvement efforts of the company. Rather than focusing solely on the price of titanium, Scott can balance price and quality in future purchase decisions.

2.  Future problems can arise in the supply chain. Bentfield may need to go back to the previous suppliers. But Best Bikes’ relationship with them may have been damaged, and they may now be selling all their available titanium to other manufacturers. Lower quality bicycles could also affect Best Bikes’ reputation with the distributors, the bike shops, and customers, leading to higher warranty claims and customer dissatisfaction, and decreased sales in the future.

$610 U

Total efficiency variance

F = favorable effect on operating income; U = unfavorable effect on operating income.

The direct materials mix variance of $1,440 F indicates that the actual product mix uses relatively more of less-expensive ingredients than planned. In this case, the actual mix contains slightly more almonds and pistachios while using fewer cashews and substantially less seasoning.

The direct materials yield variance of $2,050 U occurs because the amount of total inputs needed (16,000 cups) exceeded the budgeted amount (15,000 cups) expected to produce 2,500 tins.

The direct materials yield variance is significant enough to be investigated. The mix variance may be within expectations but should be monitored since it is favorable largely due to the use of less seasoning, which is considered an important element of the product’s appeal to customers.

1. 4,700 units × 0.5 hours/unit = 2,350 hours

1.  Flexible budget – Efficiency variance = $37,600 – $2,000 = $35,600

> Actual dir. manuf. labor hours = $35,600 ÷ Budgeted price of $16/hour = 2,225 hours

1.  $35,600 + Price variance, $1,700 = $37,300, the actual direct manuf. labor cost

####### Actual rate = Actual cost ÷ Actual hours = $37,300 ÷ 2,225 hours = $17/hour (rounded)

1.  Standard qty. of direct materials = 4,700 units × 2 pounds/unit = 9,400 pounds

2.  Flexible budget + Dir. matls. effcy. var. = $28,200 + $2,900 = $31,100

###### Actual quantity of dir. matls. used = $31,100 ÷ Budgeted price per lb

1.  Actual cost of direct materials, $36,300 – Price variance, $4,500 = $31,800

> Actual qty. of direct materials purchased = $31,800 ÷ Budgeted price, $3/lb = 10,600 lbs.

7. Actual direct materials price = $36,300 ÷ 10,600 lbs = $3.42 per lb.

3. Plausible explanations for the above variances include:

Zanella paid a little less for the wool, but the wool was lower quality (more knots in the yarn that had to be cut out), and workers had to use more of it. Zanella used more experienced workers in April than she usually does. This resulted in payment of higher wages per hour, but the new workers were more efficient and took fewer hours than normal. However, overall the higher wage rates resulted in Zanella’s total wage bill being higher than expected.

We illustrate these calculations for Firm A.

The DM Price Variance is computed as:

> (Firm A Price – Benchmark Price) × Firm A Usage

= ($5.00 – $5.10) × 2.15 oz.

= $0.22 F

The DM Efficiency Variance is computed as follows:

(Firm A Usage – Benchmark Usage) × Benchmark Price

= (2.15 oz. – 2.15 oz.) × $5.10

= $0

The DL Price Variance is computed as:

(Firm A Rate – Benchmark Rate) × Firm A Hours

= ($14.50 – $12.50) × 0.75

= $1.50 U

The DL Efficiency Variance is computed as follows:

(Firm A Usage – Benchmark Usage) × Benchmark Rate

> = (0.75 hrs. – 0.70 hrs.) × $12.50
>
> = $0.63 U
>
> The % over standard is the percentage difference in prices relative to the Industry Benchmark. Again using the DM Price Variance calculation for Firm A, the % over standard is given by:

(Firm A Price – Benchmark Price)/Benchmark Price

= ($5.00 - $5.10)/$5.10

= 1.96% under standard.

- Some of our competitors are targeting the market for high-end and custom-made lenses. I'm not sure that looking at their costs helps with understanding ours better.

> - We may focus too much on cost differentials and not enough on differentiating ourselves, maintaining our competitive advantages, and growing our margins.

> - We may want to find out whether we can get the same lower price for glass as Firm D.
>
> - We may want to re-evaluate the training our employees receive given our level of unfavorable labor efficiency variance compared to the benchmark.
>
> - Can we use Firm B’s materials efficiency and Firm C’s variable overhead consumption levels as our standards for the coming year?
>
> - It is unclear why the trade association is still using $12.50 for the labor rate benchmark. Given the difficulty of hiring qualified workers, real wage rates are now substantially higher. We pay our workers $2 more per hour, and at least one of our competitors pays even higher wages than we do! Firm B does pay $0.50 less than we do per hour and that may be worth looking into.

4. Solution Exhibit 7-39B presents the total direct labor yield and mix variances for Trevor Joseph Guitars.

The total direct labor yield variance can also be computed as the sum of the direct labor yield variances for each input:

|     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| =   |     | ×   | ×   |

George = (253 – 250) × 0.60 × $30 = 3 × 0.60 × $30 = $54 U

Earl = (253 – 250) × 0.40 × $20 = 3 × 0.40 × $20 = *24* U

Total direct labor yield variance $78 U

The total direct labor mix variance can also be computed as the sum of the direct labor mix variances for each input:

|     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| =   |     | ×   | ×   |

George = (0.573 – 0.60) × 253 × $30 = 0.027 × 253 × $30 = $205 F

Earl = (0.427 – 0.40) × 253 × $20 = –0.027 × 253 × $20= *137* U

Total direct labor mix variance $ 68 F

The sum of the direct labor mix variance and the direct labor yield variance equals the direct labor efficiency variance. The favorable mix variance arises from using more of the cheaper labor (and less of the costlier labor) than the budgeted mix. The yield variance indicates that the guitars required more total inputs (253 hours) than expected (250 hours) for the production of 25 guitars. Both variances are relatively small and probably within tolerable limits. It is likely that Earl, who is less experienced, worked more slowly than George, which caused the unfavorable yield variance. Trevor Joseph should be careful that using more of the cheaper labor does not reduce the quality of the guitar or how customers perceive it.

Comments on the variances include:

-   Selling price variance. This may arise from a proactive decision to reduce price to expand market share or from a reaction to a price reduction by a competitor. It could also arise from unplanned price discounting by salespeople.

-   Material price variance. The $0.01 increase in the price per connector pin could arise from uncontrollable market factors or from poor contract negotiations by MicroDisk.

<!-- -->

-   Material efficiency variance. For all three material inputs, usage is greater than budgeted. Possible reasons include lower-quality inputs, use of lower-quality workers (although this is not reflected in the labor price variances), and the setup and fabrication equipment not being maintained in a fully operational mode. The higher price paid for connector pins (and perhaps higher quality of pins) did not reduce the number of connector pins used to produce actual output.

<!-- -->

-   Labor efficiency variance. There is a small favorable efficiency variance for setup labor and a larger one for fabrication, which could both result from workers eliminating non-value-added steps in production.

-   Labor price variance. There is an unfavorable price variance for fabrication as a result of the $1 higher wage per hour paid for that labor. The higher labor quality could also explain the significant efficiency variance for fabrication labor.

> 2. Actions employees may have taken include:

1.  Adding steps that are not necessary in working on a GPS unit

> (b) Taking more time on each step than is necessary
>
> (c) Creating problem situations so that the budgeted amount of average downtime and rates of spoilage of materials will be overstated
>
> (d) Creating defects in units so that the budgeted amount of average rework will be overstated

Employees may take these actions for several possible reasons.

1.  They may be paid on a piece-rate basis with incentives for above-budgeted

> production.

1.  They may want to create a relaxed work atmosphere, and a less-demanding standard can reduce stress.

2.  They have a “them versus us” mentality rather than a partnership perspective.

3.  They may want to gain all the benefits that ensue from superior performance (job security, wage rate increases) without putting in the extra effort required.

This behavior is unethical if it is deliberately designed to undermine the credibility of the standards used at Sunto Scientific.

3. If Williams does nothing about standard costs, his behavior will violate the “Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants.” In particular, he would be violating the

1.  standards of competence, by not performing technical duties in accordance with relevant standards;

2.  standards of integrity, by passively subverting the attainment of the organization’s objective to control costs; and

3.  standards of credibility, by not communicating information fairly and not disclosing all relevant cost information.

4. Williams should discuss the situation with Kelso and point out that the standards are lax and that this practice is unethical. If Kelso does not agree to change, Williams should escalate the issue up the hierarchy in order to effect change. If organizational change is not forthcoming, Williams should be prepared to resign rather than compromise his professional ethics.

5. Main pros of using Competitive Intelligence Institute information to compute variances are

> (a) highlights to Sunto in a direct way how it may or may not be cost-competitive.
>
> (b) provides a “reality check” to many internal positions about efficiency or effectiveness.

Main cons are

1.  sunto (and the Savannah plant in particular) may not be comparable to companies in the database.

2.  cost data about other companies may not be reliable.

3.  cost of Competitive Intelligence Institute reports.
