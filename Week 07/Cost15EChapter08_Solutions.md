**FLEXIBLE BUDGETS, OVERHEAD COST VARIANCES, AND **

**MANAGEMENT CONTROL**

**8-1** Effective planning of variable overhead costs involves:

1.  Planning to undertake only those variable overhead activities that add value for customers using the product or service, and

<!-- -->

1.  Planning to use the drivers of costs in those activities in the most efficient way.

**8-2** At the start of an accounting period, a larger percentage of fixed overhead costs are locked-in than is the case with variable overhead costs. When planning fixed overhead costs, a company must choose the appropriate level of capacity or investment that will benefit the company over a long time. This is a strategic decision.

**8-3** The key differences are how direct costs are traced to a cost object and how indirect costs

are allocated to a cost object:

                                         × Standard quantity of cost-allocation base allowed for actual output  |

**8-4** Steps in developing a budgeted variable-overhead cost rate are

> 1. Choose the period to be used for the budget.
>
> 2. Select the cost-allocation bases to use in allocating variable overhead costs to the output produced.

1.  Identify the variable overhead costs associated with each cost-allocation base.

2.  Compute the rate per unit of each cost-allocation base used to allocate variable overhead costs to output produced.

**8-5** Two factors affect the spending variance for variable manufacturing overhead:

> a. price changes of individual inputs (such as energy and indirect materials) included in variable overhead relative to budgeted prices
>
> b. percentage change in the actual quantity used of individual items included in variable overhead cost pool, relative to the percentage change in the quantity of the cost driver of the variable overhead cost pool

**8-6** Possible reasons for a favorable variable-overhead efficiency variance include:

-   Workers are more skillful in using machines than budgeted.

-   Production scheduler was able to schedule jobs better than budgeted, resulting in lower-than-budgeted machine-hours.

-   Machines operated with fewer slowdowns than budgeted.

-   Machine time standards were overly lenient.

**8-7** A direct materials efficiency variance indicates whether more or less direct materials were used than was budgeted for the actual output achieved. A variable manufacturing overhead efficiency variance indicates whether more or less of the chosen allocation base was used than was budgeted for the actual output achieved.

**8-8** Steps in developing a budgeted fixed-overhead rate are

1.  Choose the period to use for the budget.

2.  Select the cost-allocation base to use in allocating fixed overhead costs to output produced.

3.  Identify the fixed-overhead costs associated with each cost-allocation base.

4.  Compute the rate per unit of each cost-allocation base used to allocate fixed overhead costs to output produced.

**8-9** The relationship for fixed-manufacturing overhead variances is:

There is never an efficiency variance for fixed overhead because managers cannot be more or less efficient in dealing with an amount that is fixed regardless of the output level. The result is that the flexible-budget variance amount is the same as the spending variance for fixed-manufacturing overhead.

**8-10** For planning and control purposes, fixed overhead costs are a lump sum amount that is not controlled on a per-unit basis. In contrast, for inventory costing purposes, fixed overhead costs are allocated to products on a per-unit basis.

**8-11** An important caveat is what change in selling price might have been necessary to attain the level of sales assumed in the denominator of the fixed manufacturing overhead rate. For example, the entry of a new low-price competitor may have reduced demand below the denominator level if the budgeted selling price was maintained. An unfavorable production-volume variance may be small relative to the selling-price variance had prices been dropped to attain the denominator level of unit sales.

**8-12** A strong case can be made for writing off an unfavorable production-volume variance to cost of goods sold. The alternative is prorating it among inventories and cost of goods sold, but this would “penalize” the units produced (and in inventory) for the cost of unused capacity, i.e., for the units *not* produced. But, if we take the view that the denominator level is a “soft” number—i.e., it is only an estimate, and it is never expected to be reached exactly—then it makes more sense to prorate the production volume variance—whether favorable or not—among the inventory stock and cost of goods sold. Prorating a favorable variance is also more conservative: It results in a lower operating income than if the favorable variance had all been written off to cost of goods sold. Finally, prorating also dampens the efficacy of any steps taken by company management to manage operating income through manipulation of the production volume variance. In sum, a production-volume variance need not always be written off to cost of goods sold.

**8-13** The four variances are

-   Variable manufacturing overhead costs

<!-- -->

-   spending variance

-   efficiency variance

<!-- -->

-   Fixed manufacturing overhead costs

<!-- -->

-   spending variance

-   production-volume variance

**8-14** Interdependencies among the variances could arise for the spending and efficiency variances. For example, if the chosen allocation base for the variable overhead efficiency variance is only one of several cost drivers, the variable overhead spending variance will include the effect of the other cost drivers. As a second example, interdependencies can be induced when there are misclassifications of costs as fixed when they are variable and vice versa.

**8-15** Flexible-budget variance analysis can be used in the control of costs in an activity area by isolating spending and efficiency variances at different levels in the cost hierarchy. For example, an analysis of batch costs can show the price and efficiency variances from being able to use longer production runs in each batch relative to the batch size assumed in the flexible budget.

Spending variance Never a variance Production-volume variance

$1,516 U $2,400 F

Flexible-budget variance Production-volume variance

The fixed manufacturing overhead spending variance and the fixed manufacturing flexible budget variance are the same––$1,516 U. Esquire spent $1,516 more than the $62,400 budgeted amount for June 2014.

The production-volume variance is $2,400 F. This arises because Esquire utilized its capacity more intensively than budgeted (the actual production of 1,080 suits exceeds the budgeted 1,040 suits). This results in overallocated fixed manufacturing overhead of $2,400 (4 × 40 × $15). Esquire would want to understand the reasons for a favorable production-volume variance. Is the market growing? Is Esquire gaining market share? Will Esquire need to add capacity?

1.  Spending variance of $176,400 U. It is unfavorable because variable manufacturing overhead was 35 percent higher than planned. A possible explanation could be an increase in energy rates relative to the rate per standard labor-hour assumed in the flexible budget.

Efficiency variance of $56,000 F. It is favorable because the actual number of direct manufacturing labor-hours required was lower than the number of hours in the flexible budget. Labor was more efficient in producing the baguettes than management had anticipated in the budget. This could occur because of improved morale in the company, which could result from an increase in wages or an improvement in the compensation scheme.

Flexible-budget variance of $120,400 U. It is unfavorable because the favorable efficiency variance was not large enough to compensate for the large unfavorable spending variance.

1.  The fixed manufacturing overhead is underallocated by $48,000.

2.  The production-volume variance of $32,000 U captures the difference between the budgeted 3,200,0000 baguettes and the lower actual 2,800,000 baguettes produced—the fixed cost capacity not used. The spending variance of $16,000 U means that the actual aggregate of fixed costs ($272,000) exceeds the budget amount ($256,000). For example, monthly leasing rates for baguette-making machines may have increased above those in the budget for 2014.

3. Planning and control of *variable* manufacturing overhead costs have both a long-run and a short-run focus. It involves Principles planning to undertake only value-added overhead activities (a long-run view) and then managing the cost drivers of those activities in the most efficient way (a short-run view). Planning and control of *fixed* manufacturing overhead costs at Principles have primarily a long-run focus. It involves undertaking only value-added fixed-overhead activities for a budgeted level of output. Principles make most of the key decisions that determine the level of fixed-overhead costs at the start of the accounting period.

3. Individual fixed manufacturing overhead items are not usually affected very much by day-to-day control. Instead, they are controlled periodically through planning decisions and budgeting procedures that may sometimes have horizons covering six months or a year (for example, management salaries) and sometimes covering many years (for example, long-term leases and depreciation on plant and equipment).

4. The fixed overhead spending variance is caused by the actual realization of fixed costs differing from the budgeted amounts. Some fixed costs are known because they are contractually specified, such as rent or insurance, although if the rental or insurance contract expires during the year, the fixed amount can change. Other fixed costs are estimated, such as the cost of managerial salaries, which may depend on bonuses and other payments not known at the beginning of the period. In this example, the spending variance is unfavorable, so actual FOH is greater than the budgeted amount of FOH.

The fixed overhead production volume variance is caused by production being over or under expected capacity. You may be under capacity when demand drops from expected levels or if there are problems with production. Over capacity is usually driven by favorable demand shocks or a desire to increase inventories. The fact that there is a favorable volume variance indicates that production exceeded the expected level of output (4,400 units actual relative to a denominator level of 4,000 output units).

3. The control of variable manufacturing overhead requires the identification of the cost drivers for such items as energy, supplies, and repairs. Control often entails monitoring nonfinancial measures that affect each cost item, one by one. Examples are kilowatt-hours used, quantities of lubricants used, and repair parts and hours used. The most convincing way to discover why overhead performance did not agree with a budget is to investigate possible causes, line item by line item.

4. The variable overhead spending variance is unfavorable. This means the actual rate applied to the manufacturing costs is higher than the budgeted rate. Because variable overhead consists of several different costs, this could be for a variety of reasons, such as the utility rates being higher than estimated or the indirect materials costs per unit of denominator activity being more than estimated.

The variable overhead efficiency variance is favorable, which implies that the estimated denominator activity was too high. Because the denominator activity is machine hours, this could be the result of efficient use of machines, better scheduling of production runs, or machines that are well maintained and thus are working at more than the expected level of efficiency.

Spending variance Production-volume variance

3. The spending variances for variable and fixed overhead are both unfavorable. This means that EMN had increases over budget in either or both the cost of individual items (such as telephone calls and gasoline) in the overhead cost pools, or the usage of these individual items per unit of the allocation base (delivery time). The favorable efficiency variance for variable overhead costs results from more efficient use of the cost allocation base––each delivery takes 0.66 hours versus a budgeted 0.70 hours.

EMN can best manage its fixed overhead costs by long-term planning of capacity rather than day-to-day decisions. This involves planning to undertake only value-added fixed-overhead activities and then determining the appropriate level for those activities. Most fixed overhead costs are committed well before they are incurred. In contrast, for variable overhead, a mix of long-run planning and daily monitoring of the use of individual items is required to manage costs efficiently. EMN should plan to undertake only value-added variable-overhead activities (a long-run focus) and then manage the cost drivers of those activities in the most efficient way (a short-run focus).

There is no production-volume variance for variable overhead costs. The unfavorable production-volume variance for fixed overhead costs arises because EMN has unused fixed overhead resources that it may seek to reduce in the long run.

**8-25** (45−50 min.) **Total overhead, 3-variance analysis.**

1. This problem has two major purposes: (a) to give experience with data allocated on a total overhead basis instead of on separate variable and fixed bases and (b) to reinforce distinctions between actual hours of input, budgeted (standard) hours allowed for actual output, and denominator level.

An analysis of direct manufacturing labor will provide the data for actual hours of input and standard hours allowed. One approach is to plug the known figures (designated by asterisks) into the analytical framework and solve for the unknowns. The direct manufacturing labor efficiency variance can be computed by subtracting $9,640 from $14,440. The complete picture is as follows:

###### Direct Labor calculations

Actual input × Budgeted rate = Actual costs – Price variance

= $202,440 – $9,640 = $192,800

Actual input = $192,800 ÷ Budgeted rate = $192,800 ÷ $16 = 12,050 hours

Budgeted input × Budgeted rate = $192,800 – Efficiency variance

= $192,800 – $4,800 = $188,000

Budgeted input = $188,000 ÷ Budgeted rate = $188,000 ÷ 16 = 11,750 hours

= 10,000<sup>\*</sup> × $8.00 = $117,600

2. The calculations for total overhead are given below.

*Repair Overhead*

> Variable overhead rate = $64,000<sup>\*</sup> ÷ 8,000<sup>\*</sup> hrs. = $8.00 per standard labor-hour
>
> = $197,600<sup>\*</sup> – 10,000<sup>\*</sup> × ($8.00) = $117,600

If total overhead is allocated at 120% of direct labor-cost, the single overhead rate must be 120% of $16.00, or $19.20 per hour. Therefore, the fixed overhead component of the rate must be $19.20 – $8.00, or $11.20 per direct labor-hour.

3. The control of variable manufacturing overhead requires the identification of the cost drivers for such items as energy, supplies, equipment, and maintenance. Control often entails monitoring nonfinancial measures that affect each cost item, one by one. Examples are kilowatts used, quantities of lubricants used, and equipment parts and hours used. The most convincing way to discover why overhead performance did not agree with a budget is to investigate possible causes, line item by line item.

Individual fixed manufacturing overhead items are not usually affected very much by day-to-day control. Instead, they are controlled periodically through planning decisions and budgeting that may sometimes have horizons covering six months or a year (for example, management salaries) and sometimes covering many years (for example, long-term leases and depreciation on plant and equipment).

(720 × 1.5 × $6\*)

$11,400 $10,800 $6,480

$600 U $4,320 U

 Spending variance Production-volume variance
=============================================

\* fixed overhead rate = (budgeted fixed overhead)/(budgeted DL hours at capacity)

= $10,800/(1,200 × 1.5 hours)

= $10,800/1,800 hours

= $6/hour

3. An unfavorable production-volume variance measures the cost of unused capacity. Production at capacity would result in a production-volume variance of zero because the fixed overhead rate is based on expected hours at capacity production. However, the existence of an unfavorable volume variance does not necessarily imply that management is doing a poor job or incurring unnecessary costs. Two reasons can be identified.

> a. For most products, demand varies from month to month while commitment to the factors that determine capacity, e.g., size of the workshop or supervisory staff, tends to remain relatively constant. If Marissa wants to meet demand in high demand months, it will have excess capacity in low demand months. In addition, forecasts of future demand contain uncertainty due to unknown future factors. Having some excess capacity would allow Marissa to produce enough to cover peak demand as well as slack to deal with unexpected demand surges in non-peak months.
>
> b. Basic economics provides a demand curve that shows a tradeoff between price charged and quantity demanded. Potentially, Marissa could have a lower net revenue if they produce at capacity and sell at a lower price than if they sell at a higher price at some level below capacity.

In addition, the unfavorable production-volume variance may not represent a feasible cost savings associated with lower capacity. Even if Marissa could shift to lower fixed costs by lowering capacity, the fixed cost may behave as a step function. If so, fixed costs would decrease in fixed amounts associated with a range of production capacity, not a specific production volume. The production-volume variance would only accurately identify potential cost savings if the fixed cost function is continuous, not discrete.

4. The static-budget operating income for February is:

Revenues $55 × 1,200 $66,000

Variable costs $25 × 1,200 30,000

Fixed overhead costs *10,800*

Static-budget operating income $25,200

The flexible-budget operating income for February is:

Revenues $55 × 720 $39,600

Variable costs $25 × 720 18,000

Fixed overhead costs *10,800*

Flexible-budget operating income $10,800

The sales-volume variance represents the difference between the static-budget operating income and the flexible-budget operating income:

Static-budget operating income $25,200

Flexible-budget operating income *10,800*

Sales-volume variance $14,400 U

Equivalently, the sales-volume variance captures the fact that when Marissa sells 720 units instead of the budgeted 1,200, only the revenue and the variable costs are affected. Fixed costs remain unchanged. Therefore, the shortfall in profit is equal to the budgeted contribution margin per unit times the shortfall in output relative to budget.

= – ×

**=** ($55 – $25) × 480 = $30 × 480 = $14,400 U

In contrast, we computed in requirement 2 that the production-volume variance was $4,320 U. This captures only the portion of the budgeted fixed overhead expected to be unabsorbed because of the 480-unit shortfall. To compare it to the sales-volume variance, consider the following:

Budgeted selling price $55

Budgeted variable cost per unit $25

Budgeted fixed cost per unit ($10,800 ÷ 1,200) *9*

Budgeted cost per unit *34*

Budgeted profit per unit $ 21

Operating income based on budgeted profit per unit

$21 per unit × 720 units $15,120

The $4,320 U production-volume variance explains the difference between operating income based on the budgeted profit per unit and the flexible-budget operating income:

Operating income based on budgeted profit per unit $15,120

Production-volume variance *4,320* U

Flexible-budget operating income $10,800

Because the sales-volume variance represents the difference between the static- and flexible-budget operating incomes, the difference between the sales-volume and production-volume variances, which is referred to as the operating-income volume variance, is:

Operating-income volume variance

= Sales-volume variance – Production-volume variance

= Static-budget operating income – Operating income based on budgeted profit per unit

= $25,200 U – $15,120 U = $10,080 U.

The operating-income volume variance explains the difference between the static-budget operating income and the budgeted operating income for the units actually sold. The static-budget operating income is $25,200 and the budgeted operating income for 720 units would have been $15,120 ($21 operating income per unit 720 units). The difference, $10,080 U, is the operating-income volume variance, i.e., the 480 unit drop in actual volume relative to budgeted volume would have caused an expected drop of $10,080 in operating income, at the budgeted operating income of $21 per unit. The operating-income volume variance assumes that $4,320 in fixed cost ($9 per unit 480 units) would be saved if production and sales volumes decreased by 480 units.

3. Munich Partners has done a reasonable job overall of managing its technology overhead costs. It has an unfavorable variable overhead efficiency variance because it used too many CPU units of processing time relative to the number of client interactions it had. This is not an issue if the goal was to meet the high-performance computing needs of clients and resulted in higher levels of client satisfaction or revenues. For the 4,000 CPU units used, Munich Partners spent $1.375 per unit relative to the budgeted $1.50, so the price/spending variance on variable technology overhead was favorable.

From the standpoint of capacity utilization, Munich Partners were successful at managing their fixed technology overhead resources. They handled 15,000 client interactions, compared to an expected output of 14,000. It would be useful to know what the firm views as the maximum attainable level of capacity given its current spending on technology. This is particularly significant because Munich Partners spent an additional $1,000 more than the expected expenditure on fixed resources for the period. The firm should attempt to identify the causes of this negative spending variance and assess whether this higher spending level is likely to persist in future years.

<sup>\*</sup>Denominator level (Annual) in pounds of material: 410,000 × 0.3 = 123,000 pounds

2. The direct materials price variance indicates that DDC paid more for brass than they had planned. If this is because they purchased a higher quality of brass, it may explain why they used less brass than expected (leading to a favorable material efficiency variance). In turn, because variable manufacturing overhead is assigned based on pounds of materials used, this directly led to the favorable variable overhead efficiency variance. The purchase of a better quality of brass may also explain why it took less labor time to produce the doorknobs than expected (the favorable direct labor efficiency variance). Finally, the unfavorable direct labor price variance could imply that the workers who were hired were more experienced than expected, which could also be related to the positive direct material and direct labor efficiency variances.

**8-30** (30 min.) **Comprehensive variance analysis.**

1. Budgeted number of machine-hours planned can be calculated by multiplying the number of units planned (budgeted) by the number of machine-hours allocated per unit:

588 units × 3 machine-hours per unit = 1,764 machine-hours.

2. Budgeted fixed MOH costs per machine-hour can be computed by dividing the flexible budget amount for fixed MOH (which is the same as the static budget) by the number of machine-hours planned (calculated in 1.):

$343,980 ÷ 1,764 machine-hours = $195.00 per machine-hour.

3. Budgeted variable MOH costs per machine-hour are calculated as budgeted variable MOH costs divided by the budgeted number of machine-hours planned:

$72,324 ÷ 1,764 machine-hours = $41.00 per machine-hour.

1.  Budgeted number of machine-hours allowed for actual output achieved can be calculated by dividing the flexible-budget amount for variable MOH by budgeted variable MOH costs per machine-hour:

$79,950 ÷ $41.00 per machine-hour= 1,950 machine-hours allowed.

1.  The actual number of output units is the budgeted number of machine-hours allowed for actual output achieved divided by the planned allocation rate of machine hours per unit:

1,950 machine-hours ÷ 3 machine-hours per unit = 650 units.

1.  The actual number of machine-hours used per output unit is the actual number of machine hours used (given) divided by the actual number of units manufactured:

1,170 machine-hours ÷ 650 units = 1.8 machine-hours used per output unit.

<sup>\*</sup>Alternative computation: 1,125,000 budgeted hrs. allowed – 1,000,000 denominator hrs. = 125,000 hrs.

3. The underallocated variable manufacturing overhead was $825,000 and overallocated fixed overhead was $2,025,000. The flexible-budget variance and underallocated overhead are always the same amount for variable manufacturing overhead because the flexible-budget amount of variable manufacturing overhead and the allocated amount of variable manufacturing overhead coincide. In contrast, the budgeted and allocated amounts for fixed manufacturing overhead only coincide when the budgeted input of the allocation base for the actual output level achieved exactly equals the denominator level.

4. The choice of the denominator level will affect inventory costs. The new fixed manufacturing overhead rate would be $17,000,000 ÷ 1,700,000 = $10.00 per machine-hour. In turn, the allocated amount of fixed manufacturing overhead and the production-volume variance would change as seen below:

<sup>*\**</sup>Alternate computation: (1,700,000 – 1,125,000) × $10.00 = $5,750,000 U

The major point of this requirement is that inventory costs (and, hence, income determination) can be heavily affected by the choice of the denominator level used for setting the fixed manufacturing overhead rate.

<sup>a</sup>Budgeted FMOH rate = Standard fixed manufacturing overhead allocated ÷ Standard machine-hours allowed for actual output achieved = $86,800 ÷ 6,200 = $14.

<sup>b</sup> Budgeted hours allowed for actual output achieved must be derived from the output level variance before this figure can be derived, or because the fixed manufacturing overhead rate is $20,000 ÷ 1,000 = $20 and the allocated amount is $24,000, the budgeted hours allowed for the actual output achieved must be 1,200 ($24,000 $20).

1.  Actual number of setups = Actual books produced / Actual books per setup

1.  Budgeted direct variable cost of a setup

> = Budgeted variable cost per setup-hour × Budgeted number of setup-hours

Budgeted total cost of a setup

> = $910 + $20 × 7 = $1,050.

8. Rejecting an order may have implications for future orders (i.e., professors would be reluctant to order books from this publisher again). Rae Steven should consider factors such as prior history with the customer and potential future sales.

> If a book is relatively new, Rae Steven might consider running a full batch and holding the extra books in case of a second special order or just hold the extra books until next semester.
>
> If the special order comes at heavy volume times, Rae Steven should look at the opportunity cost of filling it, i.e., accepting the order may interfere with or delay the printing of other books.

**8-38** (30−40 min.) **Comprehensive review of Chapters 7 and 8, working backward from given variances.**

1. Solution Exhibit 8-38 outlines the Chapter 7 and 8 framework underlying this solution.

a. Pounds of direct materials purchased = $179,300 ÷ $1.10 = 163,000 pounds

b. Pounds of excess direct materials used = $75,900 ÷ $11.50 = 6,600 pounds

c. Variable manufacturing overhead spending variance = $10,400 – $18,100 = $7,700 F

d. Standard direct manufacturing labor rate = $1,250,000 ÷ 50,000 hours = $25 per hour

Actual direct manufacturing labor rate = $25 + $0.50 = $25.50

Actual direct manufacturing labor-hours = $535,500 ÷ $25.50

= 21,000 hours

e. Standard variable manufacturing overhead rate = $500,000 ÷ 50,000

= $10 per direct manuf. labor-hour

Variable manuf. overhead efficiency variance of $18,100 ÷ $10 = 1,810 excess hours

Actual hours – Excess hours = Standard hours allowed for units produced

21,000 – 1,810 = 19,190 hours

f. Budgeted fixed manufacturing overhead rate = $1,000,000 ÷ 50,000 hours

= $20 per direct manuf. labor-hour

Fixed manufacturing overhead allocated = $20 × 19,190 hours = $383,800

Production-volume variance = $1,000,000 – $383,800 = $616,200 U

1.  The control of variable manufacturing overhead requires the identification of the cost drivers for such items as energy, supplies, and repairs. Control often entails monitoring nonfinancial measures that affect each cost item, one by one. Examples are kilowatts used, quantities of lubricants used, and repair parts and hours used. The most convincing way to discover why overhead performance did not agree with a budget is to investigate possible causes, line item by line item.

Individual fixed overhead items are not usually affected very much by day-to-day control. Instead, they are controlled periodically through planning decisions and budgeting procedures that may sometimes have planning horizons covering six months or a year (for example, management salaries) and sometimes covering many years (for example, long-term leases and depreciation on plant and equipment).

1. Total standard production costs are based on 7,600 units of output.

> Direct materials, 7,600 × $20.00
>
> 7,600 × 5 lbs. × $4.00 (or 38,000 lbs. × $4.00) $ 152,000

> Fixed manufacturing overhead, a lump-sum budget $333,000<sup>\*</sup>

<sup>\*</sup>Fixed manufacturing overhead rate =

$9.00 **=** Budget/37,000 hours

Budget = 37,000 hours × $9.00 = $333,000

1.  15,000 RAM hours $6 per RAM hour = $90,000

2.  Actual VMOH = $90,000 – $500F (VOH spending variance) = $89,500

3.  14,850 RAM hours $6 per RAM hour = $89,100

4.  VOH efficiency variance = $90,000 – $89,100 = $900 U

5.  VOH flexible budget variance = $900U – $500F = $400 U

Allocated variable overhead will be the same as the flexible budget variable overhead of $89,100. The actual variable overhead cost is $89,500. Therefore, variable overhead is underallocated by $400.

2. In the columnar presentation of fixed overhead variance analysis, all numbers shown in bold are calculated from the given information, in the order (a)–(e).

1.  Actual FOH costs = $119,875 total overhead costs – $89,500 VOH costs = $30,375

2.  Static budget FOH lump sum = $30,375 – $1,575 spending variance = $28,800

3.  \*FOH allocation rate = $28,800 FOH static-budget lump sum 18,000 static-budget RAM-hours

> = $1.60 per RAM hour

Allocated FOH = 14,850 RAM hours $1.60 per RAM hour = $23,760

1.  PVV = $28,800 – $23,760 = $5,040 U

2.  FOH flexible budget variance = FOH spending variance = $1,575 U

Allocated fixed overhead is $23,760. The actual fixed overhead cost is $30,375. Therefore, fixed overhead is underallocated by $6,615.

Standard cost per unit = $600,000/80,000 = $7.50 per unit

Fixed manufacturing overhead rate =

**=** $200,000/(80,000 × 0.25 hrs.)

= $200,000/ 20,000 hours

= $10 per labor hour

1. Solution Exhibit 8-42 presents a columnar presentation of the variances. Based on the exhibit, the variances are as follows:

a. Direct materials efficiency variance = $10,000 U

b. Direct materials price variance = $11,000 U

c. Direct labor efficiency variance = $80,000 U

d. Direct labor price variance = $15,000 F

e. Total manufacturing overhead spending variance = $100,000 U

f. Fixed overhead flexible budget variance = Spending variance = $100,000 U

g. Fixed overhead production-volume variance = $50,000 F&lt;/LL&gt;

Note that the total variances for the period equal:

$10,000 U + $11,000 U + $80,000 U + $15,000 F + $100,000 U + $50,000 F = $136,000 U.

This represents the cumulative amount by which costs were underapplied during the year.

1.  Tom Saban’s attempt did not fully work. Even though he tried to allocate a significantly larger amount of common cost to the Georgia plant than to the Alabama plant, the cost becomes part of the fixed overhead rate and thus will only cause a large unfavorable spending variance for the Georgia plant if the cost itself is much larger than expected. Because the actual common costs were lower, the result was actually to shift Georgia’s spending variance from unfavorable to favorable! Also, the spending variance for the Alabama plant is already larger than that of the Georgia plant, and the gap between them only increases when the common fixed costs are added to both plants. That said, the inclusion of the common fixed cost does exacerbate the impact of the underproduction by Georgia relative to budget (via the higher unfavorable production volume variance) while increasing the favorable volume variance for Alabama.

5. Common fixed costs should not be allocated to units that are being evaluated for performance because common fixed costs are not controllable by those units. Thus, the units should not be responsible for such costs.

1.  Tom Saban’s behavior is not ethical. He attempted to make his friend better off by manipulating costs and overhead rates, rather than focusing on which cost system would provide the best measure of relative performance among the divisions.
