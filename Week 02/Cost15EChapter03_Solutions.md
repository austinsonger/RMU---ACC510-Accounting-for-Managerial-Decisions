FC: Fixed costs

TOI: Target operating income

**3-1** Cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis examines the behavior of total revenues, total costs, and operating income as changes occur in the units sold, selling price, variable cost per unit, or fixed costs of a product.

**3-2** The assumptions underlying the CVP analysis outlined in Chapter 3 are

1. Changes in the level of revenues and costs arise only because of changes in the number of product (or service) units sold.

2. Total costs can be separated into a fixed component that does not vary with the units sold and a variable component that changes with respect to the units sold.

3. When represented graphically, the behaviors of total revenues and total costs are linear (represented as a straight line) in relation to units sold within a relevant range and time period.

4. The selling price, variable cost per unit, and fixed costs are known and constant.

1.  Operating income is total revenues from operations for the accounting period minus cost of goods sold and operating costs (excluding income taxes):

Operating income = Total revenues from operations –

Net income is operating income plus nonoperating revenues (such as interest revenue) minus nonoperating costs (such as interest cost) minus income taxes. Chapter 3 assumes nonoperating revenues and nonoperating costs are zero. Thus, Chapter 3 computes net income as:

########  Net income = Operating income – Income taxes

**3-4** Contribution margin is the difference between total revenues and total variable costs. Contribution margin per unit is the difference between selling price and variable cost per unit. Contribution-margin percentage is the contribution margin per unit divided by selling price.

**3-5** Three methods to express CVP relationships are the equation method, the contribution margin method, and the graph method. The first two methods are most useful for analyzing operating income at a few specific levels of sales. The graph method is useful for visualizing the effect of sales on operating income over a wide range of quantities sold.

**3-6** Breakeven analysis denotes the study of the breakeven point, which is often only an incidental part of the relationship between cost, volume, and profit. Cost-volume-profit relationship is a more comprehensive term than breakeven analysis.

**3-7** CVP certainly is simple, with its assumption of output as the only revenue and cost driver, and linear revenue and cost relationships. Whether these assumptions make it simplistic depends on the decision context. In some cases, these assumptions may be sufficiently accurate for CVP to provide useful insights. The examples in Chapter 3 (the software package context in the text and the travel agency example in the Problem for Self-Study) illustrate how CVP can provide such insights. In more complex cases, the basic ideas of simple CVP analysis can be expanded.

**3-8** An increase in the income tax rate does not affect the breakeven point. Operating income at the breakeven point is zero, and no income taxes are paid at this point.

**3-9** Sensitivity analysis is a “what-if” technique that managers use to examine how an outcome will change if the original predicted data are not achieved or if an underlying assumption changes. The advent of the electronic spreadsheet has greatly increased the ability to explore the effect of alternative assumptions at minimal cost. CVP is one of the most widely used software applications in the management accounting area.

**3-10** Examples include:

Manufacturing––substituting a robotic machine for hourly wage workers

Marketing––changing a sales force compensation plan from a percent of sales dollars to a fixed salary

Customer service––hiring a subcontractor to do customer repair visits on an annual retainer basis rather than a per-visit basis

**3-11** Examples include:

Manufacturing––subcontracting a component to a supplier on a per-unit basis to avoid purchasing a machine with a high fixed depreciation cost

Marketing––changing a sales compensation plan from a fixed salary to percent of sales dollars basis

Customer service––hiring a subcontractor to do customer service on a per-visit basis rather than an annual retainer basis

**3-12** Operating leverage describes the effects that fixed costs have on changes in operating income as changes occur in units sold, and hence, in contribution margin. Knowing the degree of operating leverage at a given level of sales helps managers calculate the effect of fluctuations in sales on operating incomes.

**3-13** CVP analysis is always conducted for a specified time horizon. One extreme is a very short-time horizon. For example, some vacation cruises offer deep price discounts for people who offer to take any cruise on a day’s notice. One day prior to a cruise, most costs are fixed. The other extreme is several years. Here, a much higher percentage of total costs typically is variable.

CVP itself is not made any less relevant when the time horizon lengthens. What happens is that many items classified as fixed in the short run may become variable costs with a longer time horizon.

**3-14** A company with multiple products can compute a breakeven point by assuming there is a constant sales mix of products at different levels of total revenue.

**3-15** Yes, gross margin calculations emphasize the distinction between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing costs (gross margins are calculated after subtracting variable and fixed manufacturing costs). Contribution margin calculations emphasize the distinction between fixed and variable costs. Hence, contribution margin is a more useful concept than gross margin in CVP analysis.

1.  Operating income is expected to decrease by $1,230,000 ($1,640,000 − $410,000) if Ms. Schoenen’s proposal is accepted.

The management would consider other factors before making the final decision. It is likely that product quality would improve as a result of using state of the art equipment. Due to increased automation, probably many workers will have to be laid off. Garrett’s management will have to consider the impact of such an action on employee morale. In addition, the proposal increases the company’s fixed costs dramatically. This will increase the company’s operating leverage and risk.

**3-18** (35–40 min.) **CVP analysis, changing revenues and costs. **

1a. SP = 10% × $1,300 = $130 per ticket

The reduced commission sizably increases the breakeven point and the number of tickets required to yield a target operating income of $12,000:

**10% **

**Commission Fixed**

***(Requirement 2)* *Commission of $60***

-------------------------

Attain OI of $12,000 480 3,000

4a. The $8 delivery fee can be treated as either an extra source of revenue (as done below) or as a cost offset. Either approach increases CMU $8:

SP = $54 ($46 + $8) per ticket

VCU = $30 per ticket

CMU = $54 – $30 = $24 per ticket

FC = $36,000 a month

Q = =

= 1,500 tickets

4b. Q = =

=

= 2,000 tickets

The $8 delivery fee results in a higher contribution margin, which reduces both the breakeven point and the tickets sold to attain operating income of $12,000.

9. Alternative 1, a 11% increase in contribution margin holding revenues constant, yields the highest budgeted operating income because it has the highest increase in contribution margin without increasing fixed costs.

**3-20** (20 min.) **CVP exercises.**

1a. \[Units sold (Selling price – Variable costs)\] – Fixed costs = Operating income

\[5,000,000 ($0.50 – $0.30)\] – $900,000 = $100,000

1b. Fixed costs ÷ Contribution margin per unit = Breakeven units

$900,000 ÷ \[($0.50 – $0.30)\] = 4,500,000 units

Breakeven units × Selling price = Breakeven revenues

**3-21** (10 min.) **CVP analysis, income taxes.**

1. Monthly fixed costs = $48,200 + $68,000 + $13,000 = $129,200

Contribution margin per unit = $27,000 – $23,000 – $600 = $ 3,400

Breakeven units per month = = = 38 cars

2. Tax rate 40%

Target net income $51,000

Target operating income = $85,000

=63 cars

**3-22** (20–25 min.) **CVP analysis, income taxes.**

1. Variable cost percentage is $3.80 ÷ $9.50 = 40%

Let *R* = Revenues needed to obtain target net income

*R* – 0.40*R* – $456,000 =

0.60*R* = $456,000 + $228,000

*R* = $684,000 ÷ 0.60

*R* = $1,140,000

or,   

Proof: Revenues $1,140,000

Variable costs (at 40%) *456,000*

Contribution margin 684,000

Fixed costs *456,000*

Operating income 228,000

Income taxes (at 30%) *68,400*

Net income $ 159,600

2.a. Customers needed to break even:

Contribution margin per customer = $9.50 – $3.80 = $5.70

Breakeven number of customers = Fixed costs ÷ Contribution margin per customer

= $456,000 ÷ $5.70 per customer

= 80,000 customers

2.b. Customers needed to earn net income of $159,600:

Total revenues ÷ Sales check per customer

$1,140,000 ÷ $9.50 = 120,000 customers

3. Using the shortcut approach:

Change in net income =

= (145,000 – 120,000) × $5.70 × (1 – 0.30)

= $142,500 × 0.7 = $99,750

New net income = $99,750 + $159,600 = $259,350

Alternatively, with 145,000 customers,

Operating income = Number of customers × Selling price per customer
– Number of customers × Variable cost per customer – Fixed costs

= 145,000 × $9.50 – 145,000 × $3.80 – $456,000 = $370,500

Net income = Operating income × (1 – Tax rate) = $370,500 × 0.70 = $259,350

The alternative approach is:

Revenues, 145,000 × $9.50 $1,377,500

Variable costs at 40% *551,000*

Contribution margin 826,500

Fixed costs *  456,000*

Operating income 370,500

Income tax at 30% *111,150*

Net income $ 259,350

The net income target in units decreases from 280,000 pairs in requirement 2b to 254,545 pairs.

The net income target in units decreases from 280,000 pairs in requirement 2b to 212,658 pairs.

3c. Increase variable costs by $2.50 per unit and decrease fixed manufacturing costs by 50%.

Contribution margin per unit = $30 – $23 ($21 + $2) – (0.05 × $30) = $5.50

Fixed manufacturing costs = (1 – 0.6) × $1,200,000 = $480,000

Fixed marketing costs = $300,000

Total fixed costs = $480,000 + $300,000 = $780,000

The net income target in units decreases from 280,000 pairs in requirement 2b to 250,909 pairs.

**3-24** (10 min.) **CVP analysis, margin of safety.**

###  Contribution margin percentage = = 0.48 or 48%

2. Contribution margin percentage =

0.48 =

0.48 SP = SP – $13

0.52 SP = $13

SP = $25

3. Breakeven sales in units = Revenues ÷ Selling price = $1,500,000 ÷ $25 = 60,000 units

Margin of safety in units = Sales in units – Breakeven sales in units

= 90,000 – 60,000 = 30,000 units

> Revenues, 90,000 units × $25 $2,250,000

Breakeven revenues *1,500,000*

Margin of safety $ 750,000

1.  The risk of making a loss is low. Sales would need to decrease by 30,000 units ÷ 90,000 units = 33.33% before Lattin Corp. will make a loss. The most likely reasons for this risk to increase competition, weakness in the economy, or bad management.

**3-25** (25 min.) **Operating leverage.**

1a. Let Q denote the quantity of carpets sold

Breakeven point under Option 1

$1,000Q − $400Q = $17,400

$600Q = $17,400

Q = $17,400 ÷ $600 = 29 carpets

1b. Breakeven point under Option 2

$1,000Q − $400Q − (0.20 × $1,000Q) = 0

400Q = 0

Q = 0

2. Operating income under Option 1 = $600Q − $17,400

Operating income under Option 2 = $400Q

###  Find Q such that $600Q − $17,400 = $400Q

$200Q = $17,400

Q = $17,400 ÷ $200 = 87 carpets

Revenues = $1,000 × 87 carpets = $87,000

For Q = 87 carpets, operating income under both Option 1 ($600 × 87 – $17,400) and Option 2 ($400 × 87) = $34,800

For Q &gt; 87, say, 88 carpets,

Option 1 gives operating income = ($600 × 88) − $17,400 = $35,400

Option 2 gives operating income = $400 × 88 = $35,200

So Color Rugs will prefer Option 1.

For Q &lt; 87, say, 86 carpets,

Option 1 gives operating income = ($600 × 86) − $17,000 = $34,200

Option 2 gives operating income = $400 × 86 = $34,400

So Color Rugs will prefer Option 2.

3. Degree of operating leverage =

Under Option 1, contribution margin per unit = $1,000 – $400 = $600, so
Degree of operating leverage = = 1.5

Under Option 2, contribution margin per unit = $1,000 – $400 – 0.20 × $1,000 = $400, so
Degree of operating leverage = = 1.0

4. The calculations in requirement 3 indicate that when sales are 87 units, a percentage change in sales and contribution margin will result in 1.5 times that percentage change in operating income for Option 1, but the same percentage change in operating income for Option 2 (because there are no fixed costs in Option 2). The degree of operating leverage at a given level of sales helps managers calculate the effect of fluctuations in sales on operating incomes.

Spain has the lowest breakeven point because it has both the lowest fixed costs ($5,043,000) and the lowest variable cost per unit ($77.00). Hence, for a given selling price, Spain will always have a higher operating income (or a lower operating loss) than Italy or Singapore.

The Singapore breakeven point is 120,000 units. Hence, with sales of only 80,000 units, it has an operating loss of $4,080,000.

The 60%/40% sales mix implies that, in each bundle, 3 units are sold to new customers and 2 units are sold to upgrade customers.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 3 × $130 + 2 × $80 = $390 + $160 = $550

Breakeven point in bundles = = 30,000 bundles

Breakeven point in units is:

| Sales to new customers:                      | 30,000 bundles × 3 units per bundle | 90,000 units   |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|

| Total number of units to breakeven (rounded) | 150,000 units                       |

Alternatively,

Let *S* = Number of units sold to upgrade customers

1.5*S* = Number of units sold to new customers

Revenues – Variable costs – Fixed costs = Operating income

\[$195 (1.5*S*) + $115*S*\] – \[$65 (1.5*S*) + $35*S*\] – $16,500,000 = OI

$407.5*S* – $132.5*S* – $16,500,000 = OI

Breakeven point is 150,000 units when OI = $0 because

$275*S* = $16,500,000

*S* = 60,000 units sold to upgrade customers

1.5*S* = *90,000* units sold to new customers

3a. At New 40%/Upgrade 60% mix, each bundle contains 2 units sold to new customers and 3 units sold to upgrade customers.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 2 × $130 + 3 × $80 = $260 + $240 = $500

Breakeven point in bundles = = 33,000 bundles

3b. At New 80%/ Upgrade 20% mix, each bundle contains 4 units sold to new customers and 1 unit sold to upgrade customers.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 4 × $130 + 1 × $80 = $520 + $80 = $600

Breakeven point in bundles = = 27,500 bundles

Breakeven point in units is:

**
3-28** (15–25 min.) **Sales mix, three products.**

1.  Sales of A, B, and C are in ratio 24,000 : 96,000 : 48,000. So for every 1 unit of A, 4 (96,000 ÷ 24,000) units of B are sold, and 2 (48,000 ÷ 24,000) units of C are sold.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 1 × $5+ 4 × $4 + 2 × $3 = $5 + $16 + $6 = $27

Breakeven point in bundles = = 15,000 bundles

Breakeven point in units is:

| Product A:                         | 15,000 bundles × 1 unit per bundle  | 15,000 units   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Product B:                         | 15,000 bundles × 4 units per bundle | 60,000 units   |
| Product C:                         | 15,000 bundles × 2 units per bundle | *30,000* units |
| Total number of units to breakeven | 105,000 units                       |

Alternatively,

Let Q = Number of units of A to break even

4Q = Number of units of B to break even

4Q = Number of units of C to break even

Contribution margin – Fixed costs = Zero operating income

$5Q + $4(4Q) + $3(2Q) – $405,000 = 0

$27Q = $405,000

Q = 15,000 ($405,000 ÷ $27) units of A

4Q = 60,000 units of B

2Q = *30,000* units of C

Total = 105,000 units

2. Contribution margin:

A: 24,000 × $5 $120,000

B: 96,000 × $4 384,000

C: 48,000 × $3 *144,000*

Contribution margin $648,000

Fixed costs *405,000*

Operating income $243,000

3. Contribution margin

A: 24,000 × $5 $120,000

B: 48,000 × $4 192,000

C: 96,000 × $3 *288,000*

Contribution margin $600,000

Fixed costs *405,000*

Operating income $195,000

Sales of A, B, and C are in ratio 24,000 : 48,000 : 96,000. So for every 1 unit of A, 2 (48,000 ÷ 24,000) units of B and 4 (96,000 ÷ 24,000) units of C are sold.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 1 × $5 + 2 × $4 + 4 × $3 = $5 + $8 + $12 = $25

Breakeven point in bundles = = 16,200 bundles

Breakeven point in units is:

| Product A:                         | 16,200 bundles × 1 unit per bundle  | 16,200 units   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Product B:                         | 16,200 bundles × 2 units per bundle | 32,400 units   |
| Product C:                         | 16,200 bundles × 4 units per bundle | *64,800* units |
| Total number of units to breakeven | 113,400 units                       |

Alternatively,

Let Q = Number of units of A to break even

2Q = Number of units of B to break even

4Q = Number of units of C to break even

Contribution margin – Fixed costs = Breakeven point

$5Q + $4(2Q) + $3(4Q) – $405,000 = 0

$25Q = $405,000

Q = 16,200 ($405,000 ÷ $25) units of A

4Q = 32,400 units of B

5Q = *64,800* units of C

Total = 113,400 units

Breakeven point increases because the new mix contains less of the higher contribution margin per unit, product B, and more of the lower contribution margin per unit, product C.

4. No, it is not always better to choose the sales mix with the lowest breakeven point because this calculation ignores the demand for the various products. The company should look to and sell as much of each of the three products as it can to maximize operating income even if this means that this sales mix results in a higher breakeven point.

The Music Society would not be able to afford the new marketing director if the number of concerts were to increase to only 41 events. The addition of the new marketing director would require the Music Society to hold at least 45 concerts in order to breakeven. If only 41 concerts were held, the organization would lose $6,800 annually. The Music Society could look for other contributions to support the new marketing director’s salary or perhaps increase the number of attendees per concert if the number of concerts could not be increased beyond 41.

3. Hillmart should consider the impact of the different systems on its relationship with suppliers. The interface with Hillmart’s system may require that suppliers also update their systems. This could cause some suppliers to raise the cost of their merchandise. It could force other suppliers to drop out of Hillmart’s supply chain because the cost of the system change would be prohibitive. Hillmart may also want to consider other factors such as the reliability of different systems and the effect on employee morale if employees have to be laid off as it automates its systems.

Contribution margin per package =

> = = $1,240 per tour package

Desired variable cost per tour package = $7,500 – $1,240 = $6,260

Because the current variable cost per unit is $6,300, the unit variable cost will need to be reduced by $40 ($6,300– $6,260) to achieve the breakeven point calculated in requirement 1.

Alternate Method: If fixed cost increases by $19,000, then total variable costs must be reduced by $19,000 to keep the breakeven point of 475 tour packages.

Therefore, the variable cost per unit reduction = $19,000 ÷ 475 = $40 per tour package.

1.  Contribution margin per package = $8,200 − $6,300 = $1,900

Breakeven (packages) = Fixed costs ÷ Contribution margin per package

= $570,000 ÷ $1,900 per tour package = 300 tour packages

Breakeven point in dollars = $8,200 per package × 300 tour packages = $2,460,000

The key question for the general manager is: Can Lifetime Escapes sell enough packages at $8,200 per package to earn more total operating income than when selling packages at $7,500. Lowering the breakeven point per se is not the objective.

Alternative 4 yields the highest operating income. Choosing alternative 4 will give Derby a 20% increase in operating income \[($120,000 – $100,000)/$100,000 = 20%\], which is less than the company’s 25% targeted increase. Alternative 1also generates more operating income for Derby, but it too does not meet Derby’s target of 25% increase in operating income. Alternatives 2 and 3 actually result in lower operating income than under Derby’s current cost structure. There is no reason, however, for Derby to think of these alternatives as being mutually exclusive. For example, Derby can combine actions 1 and 4, automate the machining process and decrease variable costs by 20% while increasing fixed costs by 15%. This will result in a 38% increase in operating income as follows:

> Sales revenue 5,000 1.60 $70 $560,000
>
> Variable costs 5,000 1.60 $30 × (1 – 0.20) *  192,000*
>
> Contribution margin 368,000
>
> Fixed costs $200,000 1.15 *  230,000*
>
> Operating income $138,000

The point of this problem is that managers always need to consider broader rather than narrower alternatives to meet ambitious or stretch goals.

**3-39 (**30 min.) **CVP analysis, shoe stores (continuation of 3-38).**

1.  For an expected volume of 10,000 pairs, the owner would be inclined to choose the higher-fixed-salaries-only plan because income would be higher by $14,500 compared to the salary-plus-commission plan.

. Operating income for salary plan = $23 × 10,000 – $195,500 = $34,500

Operating income under commission pan = $20 × 10,000 – $180,000 = $20,000

But it is likely that sales volume itself is determined by the nature of the compensation plan. The salary-plus-commission plan provides a greater motivation to the salespeople, and it may well be that for the same amount of money paid to salespeople, the salary-plus-commission plan generates a higher volume of sales than the fixed-salary plan.

2. Let TQ = Target number of units

For the salary-only plan,

> $60TQ – $37TQ – $195,500 = $69,000
>
> $23TQ = $264,500
>
> TQ = $264,500 ÷ $23
>
> TQ = 11,500 units
>
> For the salary-plus-commission plan,
>
> $60TQ – $40TQ – $180,000 = $69,000
>
> $20TQ = $249,000
>
> TQ = $249,000 ÷ $20.00
>
> TQ = 12,450 units

The decision regarding the salary plan depends heavily on predictions of demand. For instance, the salary plan offers the same operating income at 11,500 units as the commission plan offers at 12,450 units.

Deckle should choose the fixed cost leasing agreement because the expected value is higher than under the commission-based leasing agreement. The range of sales is high enough to make the fixed leasing agreement more attractive.

For sales between 0 and 500 sunglasses, SuperShades prefers to pay the 8% commission because in this range, $13.40− $5,200 &gt; $15– $6,000. For sales greater than 500 sunglasses, the company prefers to pay the monthly fixed rent of $800 because $15– $6,000 &gt; $13.40− $5,200.

**
3-42** (30 min.) **CVP analysis, income taxes, sensitivity.**

1a.To breakeven, Carlisle Engine Company must sell 1,200 units. This amount represents the point where revenues equal total costs.

Let Q denote the quantity of engines sold.

Revenue = Variable costs + Fixed costs

$4,000Q = $1000Q + $4,800,000

$3,000Q = $4,800,000

> Q = 1,600 units

Breakeven can also be calculated using contribution margin per unit.

Contribution margin per unit = Selling price – Variable cost per unit = $4,000 – $1,000 = $3,000

Breakeven = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution margin per unit

> = $4,800,000 ÷ $3,000
>
> = 1,600 units

1b. To achieve its net income objective, Carlisle Engine Company must sell 2,100 units. This amount represents the point where revenues equal total costs plus the corresponding operating income objective to achieve net income of $1,200,000.

Revenue = Variable costs + Fixed costs + \[Net income ÷ (1 – Tax rate)\]

$4,000Q = $1,000Q + $4,800,000 + \[$1,200,000 ÷ (1 − 0.20)\]

$4,000Q = $1,000Q + $4,800,000 + $1,500,000

Q = 2,100 units

2. None of the alternatives will help Carlisle Engineering achieve its net income objective of $1,200,000. Alternative b, where variable costs are reduced by $300 and selling price is reduced by $400 resulting in 1,750 additional units being sold through the end of the year, yields the highest net income of $1,180,000. Carlisle’s managers should examine how to modify Alternative b to further increase net income. For example, could variable costs be decreased by more than $300 per unit or selling prices decreased by less than $400? Calculations for the three alternatives are shown below.

Alternative a

Revenues = ($4,000 × 400) + ($3,400<sup>a</sup> × 2,100) = $8,740,000

Variable costs = $1,000 × 2,500<sup>b</sup> = $2,500,000

Operating income = $8,740,000− $2,500,000 − $4,800,000 = $1,440,000

Net income = $1,440,000 × (1 − 0.20) = $1,152,000

<sup>a</sup>$4,000 – ($4,000 × 0.15) ; <sup>b</sup>400 units + 2,100 units.

Alternative b

Revenues = ($4,000 × 400) + ($3,600<sup>a</sup> × 1,750) = $7,900,000

Variable costs = ($1,000 × 400) + (700<sup>b</sup> × 1,750) = $1,625,000

Operating income = $7,900,000 − $1,625,000 − $4,800,000 = $1,475,000

Net income = $1,475,000 × (1 − 0.20) = $1,180,000

<sup>a</sup>$4,000 – 400 ; <sup>b</sup>$1,000 – $300.

Alternative c

Revenues = ($4,000 × 400) + ($2,800<sup>a</sup> × 2,200) = $7,760,000

Variable costs = $1,000 × 2,600<sup>b</sup> = $2,600,000

Operating income = $7,760,000− $2,600,000 − $4,320,000<sup>c</sup> = 840,000

Net income = $840,000 × (1 − 0.20) = $672,000

<sup>a</sup>$4,000 – ($4,000× 0.30); <sup>b</sup>400 units + 2,200nits; <sup>c</sup>$4,800,000 – ($4,800,000 × 0.10)

2. The calculations indicate that at sales of $32,000,000, a percentage change in sales and contribution margin will result in 2.23 times that percentage change in operating income if BioPharm continues to use sales agents and 2.60 times that percentage change in operating income if BioPharm employs its own sales staff. The higher contribution margin per dollar of sales and higher fixed costs gives BioPharm more operating leverage, that is, greater benefits (increases in operating income) if revenues increase but greater risks (decreases in operating income) if revenues decrease. BioPharm also needs to consider the skill levels and incentives under the two alternatives. Sales agents have more incentive compensation and, hence, may be more motivated to increase sales. On the other hand, BioPharm’s own sales force may be more knowledgeable and skilled in selling the company’s products. That is, the sales volume itself will be affected by who sells and by the nature of the compensation plan.

3. Variable costs of marketing = 16% of Revenues

Fixed marketing costs = $5,900,000

Operating income = Revenues − − − −

Denote the revenues required to earn $6,030,000 of operating income by R, then

R − 0.38R − $3,750,000 − 0.16R − $5,900,000 = $6,030,000

R − 0.38R − 0.16R = $6,030,000 + $3,750,000 + $5,900,000

0.46R = $15,680,000

R = $15,680,000÷ 0.46 = $34,086,957

1.  (15–25 min.) **Sales mix, three products.**

<!-- -->

1.  Sales of A, B, and C are in ratio 20,000 : 100,000 : 80,000. So for every 1 unit of A, 5 (100,000 ÷ 20,000) units of B are sold, and 4 (80,000 ÷ 20,000) units of C are sold.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 1 × $3 + 5 × $2 + 4 × $1 = $3 + $10 + $4 = $17

Breakeven point in bundles = = 15,000 bundles

Breakeven point in units is:

| Product A:                         | 15,000 bundles × 1 unit per bundle  | 15,000 units   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Product B:                         | 15,000 bundles × 5 units per bundle | 75,000 units   |
| Product C:                         | 15,000 bundles × 4 units per bundle | *60,000* units |
| Total number of units to breakeven | 150,000 units                       |

Alternatively,

Let Q = Number of units of A to break even

5Q = Number of units of B to break even

4Q = Number of units of C to break even

Contribution margin – Fixed costs = Zero operating income

$3Q + $2(5Q) + $1(4Q) – $255,000 = 0

$17Q = $255,000

Q = 15,000 ($255,000 ÷ $17) units of A

5Q = 75,000 units of B

4Q = *60,000* units of C

Total = 150,000 units

2. Contribution margin:

A: 20,000 × $3 $ 60,000

B: 100,000 × $2 200,000

C: 80,000 × $1 *80,000*

Contribution margin $340,000

Fixed costs *255,000*

Operating income $ 85,000

3. Contribution margin

A: 20,000 × $3 $ 60,000

B: 80,000 × $2 160,000

C: 100,000 × $1 *100,000*

Contribution margin $320,000

Fixed costs *255,000*

Operating income $ 65,000

Sales of A, B, and C are in ratio 20,000 : 80,000 : 100,000. So for every 1 unit of A, 4 (80,000 ÷ 20,000) units of B and 5 (100,000 ÷ 20,000) units of C are sold.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 1 × $3 + 4 × $2 + 5 × $1 = $3 + $8 + $5 = $16

Breakeven point in bundles = = 15,938 bundles (rounded up)

Breakeven point in units is:

| Product A:                         | 15,938 bundles × 1 unit per bundle  | 15,938 units   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Product B:                         | 15,938 bundles × 4 units per bundle | 63,752 units   |
| Product C:                         | 15,938 bundles × 5 units per bundle | *79,690* units |
| Total number of units to breakeven | 159,380 units                       |

Alternatively,

Let Q = Number of units of A to break even

4Q = Number of units of B to break even

5Q = Number of units of C to break even

Contribution margin – Fixed costs = Breakeven point

$3Q + $2(4Q) + $1(5Q) – $255,000 = 0

**3-46** (20–25 min.) **Sales mix, two products.**

1. Sales of standard and deluxe carriers are in the ratio of 187,500 : 62,500. So for every 1 unit of deluxe, 3 (187,500 ÷ 62,500) units of standard are sold.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 3 × $10 + 1 × $20 = $30 + $20 = $50

Breakeven point in bundles = = 45,000 bundles

Breakeven point in units is:

| Standard carrier:                  | 45,000 bundles × 3 units per bundle | 135,000 units  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Deluxe carrier:                    | 45,000 bundles × 1 unit per bundle  | *45,000* units |
| Total number of units to breakeven | 180,000 units                       |

Alternatively,

Let Q = Number of units of Deluxe carrier to break even

3Q = Number of units of Standard carrier to break even

Revenues – Variable costs – Fixed costs = Zero operating income

$28(3Q) + $50Q – $18(3Q) – $30Q – $2,250,000 = 0

$84Q + $50Q – $54Q – $30Q = $2,250,000

$50Q = $2,250,000

Q = 45,000 units of Deluxe

3Q = 135,000 units of Standard

The breakeven point is 135,000 Standard units plus 45,000 Deluxe units, a total of 180,000 units.

2a. Unit contribution margins are: Standard: $28 – $18 = $10; Deluxe: $50 – $30 = $20

> If only Standard carriers were sold, the breakeven point would be:
>
> $2,250,000 ÷ $10 = 225,000 units.

2b. If only Deluxe carriers were sold, the breakeven point would be:

$2,250,000 ÷ $20 = 112,500 units

= 200,000($10) + 50,000($20) – $2,250,000

> = $2,000,000 + $1,000,000 – $2,250,000
>
> = $750,000

Sales of standard and deluxe carriers are in the ratio of 200,000 : 50,000. So for every 1 unit of deluxe, 4 (200,000 ÷ 50,000) units of standard are sold.

Contribution margin of the bundle = 4 × $10 + 1 × $20 = $40 + $20 = $60

Breakeven point in bundles = = 37,500 bundles

Breakeven point in units is:

| Standard carrier:                  | 37,500 bundles × 4 units per bundle | 150,000 units  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Deluxe carrier:                    | 37,500 bundles × 1 unit per bundle  | *37,500* units |
| Total number of units to breakeven | 187,500 units                       |

Alternatively,

Let Q = Number of units of Deluxe product to break even

4Q = Number of units of Standard product to break even

$28(4Q) + $50Q – $18(4Q) – $30Q – $2,250,000 = 0

$112Q + $50Q – $72Q – $30Q = $2,250,000

$60Q = $2,250,000

Q = 37,500 units of Deluxe

4Q = 150,000 units of Standard

The breakeven point is 150,000 Standard +37,500 Deluxe, a total of 187,500 units.

The major lesson of this problem is that changes in the sales mix change breakeven points and operating incomes. In this example, the budgeted and actual total sales in number of units were identical, but the propor­tion of the product having the higher contribution margin declined. Operating income suffered, falling from $875,000 to $750,000. Moreover, the breakeven point rose from 180,000 to 187,500 units.

4. Incorrect reporting of environmental costs with the goal of continuing operations is unethical. In assessing the situation, the specific “Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants” (described in Exhibit 1-7) that the management accountant should consider are listed below.

*Competence*
============

Clear reports using relevant and reliable information should be prepared. Preparing reports on the basis of incorrect environmental costs to make the company’s performance look better than it is violates competence standards. It is unethical for Madden not to report environmental costs to make the plant’s performance look good.

*Integrity*
===========

The management accountant has a responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest and advise all appropriate parties of any potential conflict. Madden may be tempted to report lower environmental costs to please Buckner and Hewitt and save the jobs of his colleagues. This action, however, violates the responsibility for integrity. The Standards of Ethical Conduct require the management accountant to communicate favorable as well as unfavorable information.

*Credibility*
=============

The management accountant’s Standards of Ethical Conduct require that information should be fairly and objectively communicated and that all relevant information should be disclosed. From a management accountant’s standpoint, underreporting environmental costs to make performance look good would violate the standard of objectivity.

Madden should indicate to Buckner that estimates of environmental costs and liabilities should be included in the analysis. If Buckner still insists on modifying the numbers and reporting lower environmental costs, Madden should raise the matter with one of Buckner’s superiors. If after taking all these steps, there is continued pressure to understate environmental costs, Madden should consider resigning from the company and not engage in unethical behavior.

3. The optimal production plan is to produce 120,000 units at the Peoria plant and 72,000 units at the Moline plant. The full capacity of the Peoria plant, 120,000 units (400 units × 300 days), should be used because the contribution from these units is higher at all levels of production than is the contribution from units produced at the Moline plant.

> Contribution margin per plant:
>
> Peoria, 96,000 × $64 $ 6,144,000
>
> Peoria 24,000 × ($64 – $3) 1,464,000
>
> Moline, 72,000 × $48 *3,456,000*
>
> Total contribution margin 11,064,000
>
> Deduct total fixed costs *6,969,600*
>
> Operating income $ 4,094,400

The contribution margin is higher when 120,000 units are produced at the Peoria plant and 72,000 units at the Moline plant. As a result, operating income will also be higher in this case because total fixed costs for the division remain unchanged regardless of the quantity produced at each plant.
