**CHAPTER 6**

**MASTER BUDGET AND RESPONSIBILITY ACCOUNTING
**

**6-1** The budgeting cycle includes the following elements:

a. Planning the performance of the company as a whole as well as planning the performance of its subunits. Management agrees on what is expected.

b. Providing a frame of reference, a set of specific expectations against which actual results can be compared.

c. Investigating variations from plans. If necessary, corrective action follows investigation.

d. Planning again, in light of feedback and changed conditions.

**6-2** The *master budget* expresses management’s operating and financial plans for a specified period (usually a fiscal year) and includes a set of budgeted financial statements. It is the initial plan of what the company intends to accomplish in the period.

**6-3** Strategy, plans, and budgets are interrelated and affect one another. Strategy specifies how an organization matches its own capabilities with the opportunities in the marketplace to accomplish its objectives. Strategic analysis underlies both long-run and short-run planning. In turn, these plans lead to the formulation of budgets. Budgets provide feedback to managers about the likely effects of their strategic plans. Managers use this feedback to revise their strategic plans.

**6-4** We agree that budgeted performance is a better criterion than past performance for judging managers because inefficiencies included in past results can be detected and eliminated in budgeting. Also, future conditions may be expected to differ from the past, and these can also be factored into budgets.

**6-5** Production and marketing traditionally have operated as relatively independent business functions. Budgets can assist in reducing conflicts between these two functions in two ways. Consider a beverage company such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola:

-   Communication. Marketing could share information about seasonal demand with production.

-   Coordination. Production could ensure that output is sufficient to meet, for example, high seasonal demand in the summer.

**6-6** In many organizations, budgets impel managers to plan. Without budgets, managers drift from crisis to crisis. Research also shows that budgets can motivate managers to meet targets and improve their performance. Thus, many top managers believe that budgets meet the cost-benefit test.

**6-7** A *rolling budget,* also called a *continuous budget,* is a budget or plan that is always available for a specified future period, by continually adding a period (month, quarter, or year) to the period that just ended. A four-quarter rolling budget for 2014 is superseded by a four-quarter rolling budget for April 2014 to March 2015, and so on.

1.  The steps in preparing an operating budget are as follows:

<!-- -->

1.  Prepare the revenues budget.

2.  Prepare the production budget (in units).

3.  Prepare the direct material usage budget and direct material purchases budget.

4.  Prepare the direct manufacturing labor budget.

5.  Prepare the manufacturing overhead budget.

6.  Prepare the ending inventories budget.

7.  Prepare the cost of goods sold budget.

8.  Prepare the nonmanufacturing costs budget.

9.  Prepare the budgeted income statement.

**6-9** The sales forecast is typically the cornerstone for budgeting because production (and, hence, costs) and inventory levels generally depend on the forecasted level of sales.

**6-10** Sensitivity analysis adds an extra dimension to budgeting. It enables managers to examine how budgeted amounts change with a change in the underlying assumptions. This assists managers in monitoring those assumptions that are most critical to a company in attaining its budget and allows them to make timely adjustments to plans when appropriate.

1.  *Kaizen budgeting* explicitly incorporates continuous improvement anticipated during the budget period into the budget numbers.

2.  Nonoutput-based cost drivers can be incorporated into budgeting by the use of activity-based budgeting (ABB). ABB focuses on the budgeted cost of activities necessary to produce and sell products and services. Nonoutput-based cost drivers, such as the number of parts, number of batches, and number of new products can be used with ABB.

**6-13** The choice of the type of responsibility center determines what the manager is accountable for and thereby affects the manager’s behavior. For example, if a revenue center is chosen, the manager will focus on revenues, not on costs or investments. The choice of a responsibility center type guides the variables to be included in the budgeting exercise.

**6-14** Budgeting in multinational companies may involve budgeting in several different foreign currencies. Further, management accountants must translate operating performance into a single currency for reporting to shareholders by budgeting for exchange rates. Managers and accountants must understand the factors that impact exchange rates and, where possible, plan financial strategies to limit the downside of unexpected unfavorable moves in currency valuations. In developing budgets for operations in different countries, they must also have good understanding of political, legal, and economic issues in those countries.

**6-15** No. Cash budgets and operating income budgets must be prepared simultaneously. In preparing their operating income budgets, companies want to avoid unnecessary idle cash and unexpected cash deficiencies. The cash budget, unlike the operating income budget, highlights periods of idle cash and periods of cash shortage, and it allows the accountant to plan cost effective ways of either using excess cash or raising cash from outside to achieve the company’s operating income goals.

Expected revenues at the new 2015 prices are $7,258,240, which is lower than the expected 2015 revenues of $7,292,680 if the prices are unchanged. So, if the goal is to maximize sales revenue and if Jim Rouse’s forecasts are reliable, the company not lower its price for a lead test in 2015.

4. Note the relatively small inventory of wheels. In Japan, suppliers tend to be located very close to the major manufacturer. Inventories are controlled by just-in-time and similar systems. Indeed, some direct materials inventories are almost nonexistent. Nevertheless, Yoshida’s managers would want to check why the target ending inventory of wheels (72,000) is greater than the beginning inventory of 55,000. Could the production process be streamlined and made more efficient to reduce the need to hold more inventories?

Furthermore, Yoshida could help improve quality, efficiency, and productivity of its wheels supplier to reduce the cost of manufacturing wheels and hence the price the supplier charges Yoshida. Toyota routinely aids its suppliers in this way and also reduces costs through better coordination between suppliers and the company.

7. If sales drop to 185,000 blue rugs, Xander should look to reduce fixed costs and produce less to reduce variable costs and inventory costs.

8. Top management can look for ways to increase (stretch) sales and improve quality, efficiency, and input prices to reduce costs in each cost category such as direct materials, direct manufacturing labor, and overhead costs. Top management can also use the budget to coordinate and communicate across different parts of the organization, create a framework for judging performance and facilitating learning, and motivate managers and employees to achieve “stretch” targets of higher revenues and lower costs.

|                                        | **2,400 jobs** |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Revenue                                | $480,000       |
| Expenses ($163 × 2,400 jobs) + $15,000 | *406,200*      |
| Operating Income                       | $ 73,800       |

Decrease in net operating income: $74,000 – $73,800 = $200. According to this analysis, the increase in revenue would not warrant the $15,000 of additional advertising cost. Therefore, the investment should not be made.

7. Using the budgeted cost per job of $163 ignores the fact that $123,000 of the company’s overhead costs are fixed. Because those costs will not increase with an increase in activity from 2,000 to 2,400 jobs, the fixed costs should not be considered in the analysis, and Sunshine’s management should examine only incremental costs versus incremental revenues.

| Revenues                   |          | $480,000  |
|----------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Wages ($14.40 × 12,000)    | $172,800 |           |
| Supplies ($4.40 × 12,000)  | 52,800   |           |
| Fuel ($0.60 × 30,000)      | 18,000   |           |
| Fixed travel costs         | 45,000   |           |
| Fixed window washing costs | 78,000   |           |
| Advertising costs          | *15,000* | *381,600* |
| Operating income           |          | $ 98,400  |

Sunshine’s operating income increases by $24,400 ($98,400 – $74,000) as a result of advertising, and so Sunshine should incur the $15,000 in additional advertising costs.

8. The following table shows Sunshine’s profitability if sales decline to 1,800 jobs.

| Revenue (1,800 jobs × 2,000 sq. ft.× 0.10/sq. ft. |          | $360,000  |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Wages ($14.40 × 9,000)                            | $129,600 |           |
| Supplies ($4.40 × 9,000)                          | 39,600   |           |
| Fuel ($0.60 × 22,500)                             | 13,500   |           |
| Fixed travel costs                                | 45,000   |           |
| Fixed window washing costs                        | *78,000* | *305,700* |
|                                                   |          | $ 54,300  |

If revenue should fall to 1,800 jobs, Sunshine’s management should examine the company’s fixed overhead costs to determine if any cuts are possible. Variable product costs will naturally decline with a decline in jobs, but fixed costs will not decline without management taking action. While depreciation cost is not likely something that management can reduce, the “other” fixed overhead costs are significant and should be examined.

Note that the employee Social Security tax of 7.5% is irrelevant. Such taxes are withheld from employees’ wages and paid to the government by the employer on behalf of the employees; therefore, the 7.5% amounts are not additional costs to the employer.

2. The budget process would prompt Roletter’s management to look for ways to reduce finished goods inventories, the manufacturing labor hours needed to produce each unit both before and after installing new labor-saving machinery; some of the other costs such as Social Security tax and workers’ compensation insurance may be fixed by law, while pension contributions and medical insurance might be features that make Roletter an attractive employer.

3. We already see one example of a decision that Roletter’s management took based on the budgeted expenses—installing labor-saving machines ahead of wage increases. Roletter’s management should also continue to work with employees to increase labor productivity.

2. Refer to the last row of the table in requirement 1. Fresh snacks, which represents the smallest portion of COGS (25%), is the product category that consumes the largest share (62.7%) of the indirect resources. Fresh snacks demand the highest level of ordering, delivery, shelf-stocking, and customer support resources of all three product categories—it has to be ordered, delivered, and stocked in small, perishable batches, and convenience store customers often require more assistance when purchasing.

3. An ABB approach recognizes how different products require different mixes of support activities. The relative percentage of how each product area uses the cost driver at each activity area is:

By recognizing these differences, Jiffy Mart’s managers are better able to budget for different unit sales levels and different mixes of individual product-line items sold. Using a single cost driver (such as COGS) assumes homogeneity in the use of indirect costs (support activities) across product lines which does not occur at Jiffy Mart. If Jiffy Mart had used COGS to allocate costs, Fresh Snacks would have been allocated 25% of the indirect costs, much lower than the 62.7% of the indirect costs based on an analysis of the activities it actually uses. Other benefits cited by managers include: (1) better identification of resource needs, (2) clearer linking of costs with staff responsibilities, and (3) identification of budgetary slack.

2. A Kaizen budgeting approach signals management’s commitment to systematic cost reduction. Compare the budgeted costs from Question 6-25 and 6-26.

|                        |               |               |                    |              |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------|
|                        | **Ordering ** | **Delivery ** | **Shelf-Stocking** | **Customer** 
                                                                                             
                                                                               **Support**   |
| Exercise 6-25          | $2,340        | $3,813        | $2,961             | $4,460       |
| Exercise 6-26 (Kaizen) | 2,321         | 3,783         | 2,938              | 4,424        |

The Kaizen budget number will show unfavorable variances for managers whose activities do not meet the required monthly cost reductions. This likely will put more pressure on managers to creatively seek out cost reductions by working “smarter” within Jiffy Mart or by having “better” interactions with suppliers or customers.

One limitation of Kaizen budgeting, as illustrated in this question, is that it assumes small incremental improvements each month. It is possible that some cost improvements arise from large discontinuous changes in operating processes, supplier networks, or customer interactions. Companies need to highlight the importance of seeking these large discontinuous improvements as well as the small incremental improvements.

A second limitation is the difficulty and challenge of determining the rate of improvement (0.4% in this example) and whether a constant percentage improvement can be sustained over a period of time.

**
6-27** (15 min.) **Responsibility and controllability. **

1.  (a) Production manager

<!-- -->

1.  Purchasing Manager

The purchasing manager has control of the cost to the extent that he/she is doing the purchasing and can seek or contract for the best price. The production manager should work with the purchasing manager. They can, together, possibly find a combination of better motor and better price for the motor than the production manager has found.

2. (a) Production Manager

1.  External Forces

In the case of the utility rate hike, the production manager would be responsible for the costs, but they are hard to control. The rates are fixed by the utility company, and there is usually no choice of which utility company is used. The production manager can try to reduce waste (turn off lights when not in use, turn of machines when not running, don’t leave water running, etc.) but other than conservation measures, the manager has no say in the utility rates. The manager might consider purchasing more energy-efficient machines.

3. (a) Van 3 driver

1.  Service manager

The driver of each van has the responsibility to stay within budget for the costs of the service vehicle. The service manager should set policies to which the drivers must adhere, including not using the van for personal use. The service manager could install GPS in the vans to make sure they are where they are supposed to be, and can also fire the driver of Van 3 for misusing company property. (Using the van for personal driving affects the tax deductibility of the van for the firm as well).

4. (a) Tropical’s service manager

1.  Cascades manager

Because Cascades has a maintenance contract with Tropical, both the hotel manager and Tropical’s service manager should work together to make sure routine maintenance is scheduled for the hotel’s hot tubs. This will decrease the number and cost of the repair emergencies. The manager should also consider the average cost of these service calls over the months where there were no calls.

5. (a) Service manager

1.  This depends…

The answer to this question really depends on why Fred Friendly works so slowly. If it is because Fred is chatting with the customers (which may be why they like him), then the service manager should tell him to only bill for actual time worked. If it is because Fred works intentionally slowly to get the overtime, then the service manager should consider disciplining him unless he is too valuable in other ways. If it is because he does not have adequate training, then HR should be involved, and the service manager should work with Fred to get him more training and with HR to make sure future hires are adequately trained.

6. (a) Service manager

1.  External forces

Like the cost of utilities, the cost of gasoline is determined externally. However, unlike the case of utilities, it is possible that the service manager can contract with a gasoline company to buy gas at a fixed price over a period of time. The advantage for Tropical is that the price is set, and the advantage for the gasoline company is that they are certain to have a long-term customer even if the price is lower than for a random customer.

**6-28** (15 min.) **Responsibility, controllability, and stretch targets. **

1. The office manager has the responsibility to follow company guidelines and write contracts herself for customers who call her directly. Diverting potential customers to the sales representative costs the company a sales commission that would not have otherwise been paid. If satisfaction surveys are sent to customers asking about their first contact with the company, this may be enough to prevent the office manager from breaking the rules.

2. Each driver is responsible for keeping an accurate accounting of his or her time. Because the drivers are paid for mileage while driving and an hourly rate while in idle, there is an incentive to report less travel time and more idle time. The cost could be controlled by using global positioning systems (GPS) to track the movement and location of the motor coaches.

3. The drivers are responsible for driving the motor coaches at fuel-efficient speeds on the highway. The maintenance technician is responsible for maintaining the vehicles to improve efficiency. An increase in fuel consumption would be difficult to pin on either employee because either could be responsible. Further, there is no incentive for the drivers to drive slower, as they are paid by the mile. Again, global positioning systems (GPS) could be used to track the movement of the vehicles. Some kind of bonus could be offered to the technician for improvements in fuel efficiency.

4. The maintenance technician is clearly responsible for completing all of the preventative maintenance. If he cannot complete the tasks during busy months, the company should consider outsourcing some of the more routine maintenance jobs. Requiring the technician to work significant overtime will likely decrease his efficiency. Ignoring routine maintenance will end up costing the company more money in fuel and repair costs.

5. Haslett has designed the stretch target system correctly. Taking advantage of loss aversion, Haslett has set a stretch target of 50 contracts rewarding the representative with a 12 percent commission (assuming paying this amount of commission is profitable). If the target is not met, the commission decreases to 8 percent. This will motivate the representatives to achieve 50 contracts.

In establishing “stretch targets,” Haslett should be sure that there are sufficient potential contracts to allow all three sales representatives to achieve the higher target. Otherwise, the stretch target may cause friction among the representatives. One or more of representatives may decide that the 8 percent commission is not sufficient incentive to stay with the company, and may leave to work for a competitor, resulting in overall reduced sales.

3. Game Depot’s managers prepare a cash budget in addition to the operating income budget to plan cash flows to ensure that the company has adequate cash to pay vendors, meet payroll, and pay operating expenses as these payments come due. Game Depot could be very profitable on an accrual accounting basis, but the pattern of cash receipts from revenues might be delayed and result in insufficient cash being available to make scheduled payments for its expenses. Game Depot’s managers may then need to initiate a plan to borrow money to finance any shortfall. Building a profitable operating plan does not guarantee that adequate cash will be available, so Game Depot’s managers need to prepare a cash budget in addition to an operating income budget.

4. The cost of inventory purchases without the discount is $8,700, which Game Depot would not have to pay until June if it buys the inventory on account in May. However, if it takes the discount and pays in May, the cost will be $8,700 × (100% – 2%) = $8,526. This means it will save $174.

> This makes total expenditures for May

|                       |            |
|-----------------------|------------|
|                       | **Costs**  |
| Inventory purchases   | $ 8,526.00 |
| Rent, utilities, etc. | 2,800.00   |
| Wages                 | *2,000.00* |
| Total                 | $13,326.00 |

Game Depot’s total cash available is $200 (cash balance) + $12,400 (cash receipts), so it will have to borrow $726 ($13,326 – $12,600) at a rate of 24 percent (or 2 percent per month.) Based on the information from \#1, it will be able to pay this back in June (assuming cash expenditures do not increase dramatically), so it will incur interest costs of $726 × 0.02 = $14.52. Because it will cost them less than $15 to save $174, it makes sense to go ahead and take the short-term loan to pay the account payable early.

Some students might interpret the question to mean that the cost of inventory purchases after taking the 2percent discount in May is $8,700. Under this interpretation, the cost of the inventory is $8,700 ÷ 0.98 = $8,878. If Game Depot takes the discount and pays in May, it will save $8,878 – $8,700 = $178

Total expenditures in May:

| Inventory purchases   | $8,700  |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Rent, utilities, etc. | 2,800   |
| Wages                 | 2,000   |
| Total                 | $13,500 |

Total cash available is $200 + $12,400 = $12,600, so Game Depot will borrow $900 ($13,500 – $12,600) at a rate of 24 percent (or 2 percent per month). The company can repay in June, so interest cost = $900 × 0.02 = $18. It will cost $18 to save $178, so Game Depot should take the short-term loan to pay the accounts payable early.**

2. Areas where continuous improvement might be incorporated into the budgeting process:

> (a) Direct materials. Either an improvement in usage or price could be budgeted. For example, the budgeted usage amounts for the fabric could be related to the maximum improvement (current usage – minimum possible usage) of yards of fabric for either blanket. It may also be feasible to decrease the price paid, particularly with quantity discounts on things like the logo patches.
>
> (b) Direct manufacturing labor. The budgeted usage of 3 hours/4 hours could be continuously revised on a monthly basis. Similarly, the manufacturing labor cost per hour of $27 could be continuously revised down. The former appears more feasible than the latter.
>
> (c) Variable manufacturing overhead. By budgeting more efficient use of the allocation base, a signal is given for continuous improvement. A second approach is to budget continuous improvement in the budgeted variable overhead cost per unit of the allocation base.
>
> (d) Fixed manufacturing overhead. The approach here is to budget for reductions in the year-to-year amounts of fixed overhead. If these costs are appropriately classified as fixed, then they are more difficult to adjust down on a monthly basis.

This means costs increase a net amount of $153,000 – 40,224 = $112,776

3. Reduction in materials can be accomplished by reducing waste and scrap. Reduction in direct labor can be accomplished by improving the efficiency of operations and decreasing down time.

Employees who make and dye the T-shirts may have suggestions for ways to do their jobs more efficiently. For instance, employees may recommend process changes that reduce idle time, setup time, and scrap. To motivate workers to improve efficiency, many companies have set up programs that share productivity gains with the workers. Trendy must be careful that productivity improvements and cost reductions do not in any way compromise product quality.

**6-32** (30–40 min.) **Revenue and production budgets.**

This is a routine budgeting problem. The key to its solution is to compute the correct *quantities* of finished goods and direct materials. Use the following general formula:

= + –

> Thingone 62,000 $172 $10,664,000
>
> Thingtwo 46,000 264 *12,144,000*
>
> Budgeted revenues $22,808,000

2. The CEO would want to probe if the revenue budget is sufficiently stretched. Is the revenue growing faster than the market? Should the company increase marketing and advertising spending to grow sales? Would increasing the sales force or giving salespersons stronger incentives result in higher sales?

**Budgeted Finished Goods Inventory**

**at December 31, 2014**

*Thingone*:

Direct materials costs:

A, 5 pounds × $11 $55

B, 3 pounds × $6 *18* $ 73

Direct manufacturing labor costs,

3 hours × $11 33

Manufacturing overhead costs at $19 per direct

manufacturing labor-hour (3 hours × $19) *57*

Budgeted manufacturing costs per unit $163

Finished goods inventory of Thingone

$163 × 26,000 units $4,238,000

*Thingtwo*:

Direct materials costs:

A, 6 pounds × $11 $66

B, 4 pounds × $6 24

C, 2 each × $5 *10* $100

Direct manufacturing labor costs,

4 hours × $14 56

Manufacturing overhead costs at $19 per direct

manufacturing labor-hour (4 hours × $19) *76*

Budgeted manufacturing costs per unit $232

Finished goods inventory of Thingtwo

$232 × 14,000 units *3,248,000*

Budgeted finished goods inventory, December 31, 2014 $7,486,000

8. The CEO would want to ask the production manager why the target ending inventories have increased. Could production be more closely tailored to demand? Could the efficiency and productivity of direct materials and direct manufacturing labor be increased? Could direct materials inventory be reduced?

9. Preparing a budget helps Saadi Corporation manage costs based on revenues and production needs, look for opportunities to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, particularly in areas where costs are high, coordinate and communicate across different parts of the organization, create a framework for judging performance and facilitating learning, and motivate managers and employees to achieve “stretch” targets of higher revenues and lower costs.

2. The budget aligns with Videocom’s key strategy of customer satisfaction through maintaining videoconferencing equipment by hiring maintenance technicians and increasing costs of customer maintenance by 14.55% ($160,000 ÷ $1,100,000) more than the 6% forecasted increase in sales.

1.  (15 min.) **Responsibility of purchasing agent.**

The cost of the biscuits is usually the responsibility of the purchasing agent, and usually controllable by the Central Warehouse. However, in this scenario, Betty the cook has taken the responsibility for the cost of the replacement biscuits from the purchasing agent by making a purchasing decision. Because Paula holds the purchasing agent responsible for biscuit costs, and presuming that Betty knew this, Betty should have discussed her decision with the purchasing agent before sending the kitchen helper to the store.

Paula should not be angry because her employees acted to satisfy the customers on a short-term emergency basis. Presuming the Central Warehouse does not consistently have problems with their freezer, there is no way the purchasing agent could foresee the biscuit shortage and plan accordingly. Also, the problem only lasted three days, which, in the course of the year (or even the month) will not seriously harm the profits of a restaurant that sells a variety of foods. However, had they run out of biscuits for three days, this could have long-term implications for customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and in the long run could harm profits as customers find other restaurants at which to eat breakfast.

Preparing a budget helps Animal Gear manage costs based on revenues and production needs, look for opportunities to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, particularly in areas where costs are high, coordinate and communicate across different parts of the organization, create a framework for judging performance and facilitating learning, and motivate management and employees to achieve “stretch” targets of higher revenues and lower costs.

Note: The solution assumes that the loan is repaid. Some students may point out that the cash balance at the end of April is anticipated to be slightly less than $10,000 \[$9,903 ($181,089 – $171,186)\], and so Animal Gear would not repay the loan. Under this assumption, the $2,000 repayment would not be shown.

2. Animal Gear’s managers prepare a cash budget in addition to the operating income budget to plan cash flows to ensure that the company has adequate cash to pay vendors, meet payroll, and pay operating expenses as these payments come due. Animal Gear could be very profitable on an accrual accounting basis, but the pattern of cash receipts from revenues might be delayed and result in insufficient cash being available to make scheduled payments for its expenses. Animal Gear’s managers may then need to initiate a plan to borrow money to finance any shortfall. Building a profitable operating plan does not guarantee that adequate cash will be available, so Animal Gear’s managers need to prepare a cash budget in addition to an operating income budget.

13. The CEO would want to probe if the revenue budget is sufficiently stretched. Is the increase growing faster than the market? Should the company increase marketing and advertising spending to grow sales? Would increasing the sales force or giving salespersons stronger incentives result in higher sales?

The CEO would want to ask the production manager if production could be more closely tailored to demand? Could the efficiency and productivity of direct materials and direct manufacturing labor be increased? Could direct materials inventory be reduced?

The CEO should set stretch targets that are challenging but achievable because creating some performance anxiety motivates employees to exert extra effort and attain better performance. A major rationale for stretch targets is the psychological motivation that comes from loss aversion—people feel the pain of loss more than the joy of success. Setting challenging targets motivates employees to reach these targets because failing to achieve a target is seen as failing. At no point should the pressure for performance push employees to engage in illegal or unethical practices. So, while setting stretch targets, the CEO must place great emphasis on adhering to codes of conduct and following appropriate norms and values. The CEO should also not set targets that are very difficult or impossible to achieve. Such targets demotivate employees because they give up on trying to achieve them.

Preparing a budget helps Skulas manage costs based on revenues and production needs, look for opportunities to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, particularly in areas where costs are high, coordinate and communicate across different parts of the organization, create a framework for judging performance and facilitating learning, and motivate management and employees to achieve “stretch” targets of higher revenues and lower costs.

1.  Yes. Skulas has a budgeted cash balance of $179,990 on 9/30/2015, and so it will be in a position to pay off the $60,000 1-year note on October 1, 2015.

2.  No. Skulas does not maintain a $14,000 minimum cash balance in July. To maintain a $14,000 cash balance in each of the three months, it could perhaps encourage its customers to pay earlier by offering a discount. Alternatively, Skulas could seek short-term credit from a bank.

4. Skulas’ managers prepare a cash budget in addition to the operating income budget to plan cash flows to ensure that the company has adequate cash to pay vendors, meet payroll, and pay operating expenses as these payments come due. Skulas could be very profitable on an accrual accounting basis, but the pattern of cash receipts from revenues might be delayed and result in insufficient cash being available to make scheduled payments for its expenses. Skulas’ managers may then need to initiate a plan to borrow money to finance any shortfall. Building a profitable operating plan does not guarantee that adequate cash will be available, so Skulas’ managers need to prepare a cash budget in addition to an operating income budget.

Under the current projections, the cash balance as of January 31, 2015, is $(8,315), which is not sufficient to enable repayment of the $107,000 note.

2. Iaia’s managers prepare a cash budget in addition to the operating income budget to plan cash flows to ensure that the company has adequate cash to pay vendors, meet payroll, and pay operating expenses as these payments come due. Iaia could be very profitable on an accrual accounting basis, but the pattern of cash receipts from revenues might be delayed and result in insufficient cash being available to make scheduled payments for its expenses. Iaia’s managers may then need to initiate a plan to borrow money to finance any shortfall. Building a profitable operating plan does not guarantee that adequate cash will be available, so Iaia’s managers need to prepare a cash budget in addition to an operating income budget. For example, the cash budget helps Iaia’s managers recognize that Iaia will not be able to repay the note in the amount of $107,000 when it comes due on January 15, 2015. The cash budget prompts Iaia’s managers to start making other arrangements for this loan, either by extending its terms or borrowing cash from elsewhere to pay it back.

13. Preparing a budget helps Hazlett manage costs based on revenues and production needs, look for opportunities to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, particularly in areas where costs are high, coordinate and communicate across different parts of the organization, create a framework for judging performance and facilitating learning, and motivate management and employees to achieve “stretch” targets of higher revenues and lower costs.

**6-41** (15 min.) **Budgeting and ethics.**

1. The standards proposed by Kurt are not challenging. In fact, he set the target at the level his department currently achieves.

Direct materials: 7.9 lbs.100 units = 790 lbs.

Direct manufacturing labor: 29 min.100 units = 2,900 min ÷ 60 = 48.33 hrs. Machine time: 23.6 min.100 units = 2,360 min. ÷ 60 = 39.33 hrs. approx

2. Kurt probably chose these standards so that his department would be able to make the goal and receive any resulting reward. With a little effort, his department can likely beat these goals.

1.  Top management should point out that the targets set by Kurt are targets that the department already achieves. Top management is seeking targets that are slightly difficult to achieve, a stretch target that would challenge workers.

> As discussed in the chapter, benchmarking might also be used to highlight the easy targets set by Kurt and to determine more challenging targets. Perhaps the organization has multiple plant locations that could be used as comparisons. Alternatively, management could use industry averages. Also, management should work with Kurt to better understand his department and encourage him to set more realistic targets. Finally, the reward structure should be designed to encourage increasing productivity, not beating the budget. Management could also set continuous improvement standards.

**6-42** (30 min.) **Human Aspects of Budgeting in a Service Firm**

1.  The manager of Bristles III has the best style because this manager is involving the workers in a decision that directly affects their work.

2.  The workers will most likely be upset or even angry with the manager of Bristles I. The manager is not a stylist and yet is changing the schedule for the stylists, assuming they can work faster and need less rest between customers, without discussing this change with them or asking for input or suggestions.

> To indicate displeasure, the stylists at Bristles I could quit, or they could perform a work slowdown. This means that the manager will schedule a customer for a 40 minute appointment, but the stylist will spend more than 40 minutes with each customer anyway. The result is that the appointments will get backed up, some customers may not get served, and overall the customers will be unhappy.
>
> Most of the workers in Bristles II are not likely to volunteer to work an extra hour a day. Although it would mean additional revenue for each stylist, it will make each work day longer, and the idea was not presented to the workers in a way that appears beneficial to the workers.
>
> To indicate displeasure with this plan, the stylist will simply not volunteer to work an extra hour a day.

1.  Of course the manager of Bristles III could implement one of the plans of the other salons. That is, workers could shorten their appointment times per customer, or lengthen their work days, or a combination of both. Alternately, workers could work six days per week rather than five. However, in the case of Bristles III, the manager has invited the stylists to help solve the problem rather than the manager telling them what changes to make, so they will be more likely to agree to make changes because they are involved in the decision.

> Other things they may do:

-   The manager may let individual stylists set their own schedules. It is possible that not all customers need an hour each, and the stylists can individually book customers in a way that works in an extra customer per day.

-   They could agree to shorter breaks.

-   They could implement a monthly contest to see who can service the most customers (but still have satisfied customers) and earn rewards, including:

    -   A name on a plaque for employee of the month (virtually no cost to the salon)

    -   Gift certificates to local businesses (low cost to the salon)

    -   Reduction in one month’s rental revenue (some cost to the salon, depending on the amount of the reduction)

    -   If the salon is in an area where parking is hard to find or costly, a month of free parking or an assigned parking space
