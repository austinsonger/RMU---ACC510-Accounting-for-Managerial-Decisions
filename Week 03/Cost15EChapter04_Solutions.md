**CHAPTER 4**

**JOB COSTING **

**4-1** *Cost pool*––a grouping of individual indirect cost items.

*Cost tracing*––the assigning of direct costs to the chosen cost object.

*Cost allocation*––the assigning of indirect costs to the chosen cost object.

> *Cost-allocation base––*a factor that links in a systematic way an indirect cost or group of indirect costs to cost objects.

**4-2** In a *job-costing system,* costs are assigned to a distinct unit, batch, or lot of a product or service. In a *process-costing system,* the cost of a product or service is obtained by using broad averages to assign costs to masses of identical or similar units.

**4-3** An advertising campaign for Pepsi is likely to be very specific to that individual client. Job costing enables all the specific aspects of each job to be identified. In contrast, the processing of checking account withdrawals is similar for many customers. Here, process costing can be used to compute the cost of each checking account withdrawal.

**4-4** The seven steps in job costing are (1) identify the job that is the chosen cost object, (2) identify the direct costs of the job, (3) select the cost-allocation bases to use for allocating indirect costs to the job, (4) identify the indirect costs associated with each cost-allocation base, (5) compute the rate per unit of each cost-allocation base used to allocate indirect costs to the job, (6) compute the indirect costs allocated to the job, and (7) compute the total cost of the job by adding all direct and indirect costs assigned to the job.

**4-5** Major cost objects that managers focus on in companies using job costing are a product such as a specialized machine, a service such as a repair job, a project such as running the Expo, or a task such as an advertising campaign.

**4-6** Three major source documents used in job-costing systems are (1) job cost record or job cost sheet, a document that records and accumulates all costs assigned to a specific job, starting when work begins; (2) materials requisition record, a document that contains information about the cost of direct materials used on a specific job and in a specific department; and (3) labor-time sheet, a document that contains information about the amount of labor time used for a specific job in a specific department.

**4-7** The main advantages of using computerized source documents for job cost records are the accuracy of the records and the ability to provide managers with instantaneous feedback to help control job costs.

**4-8** Two reasons for using an annual budget period are

> a. The numerator reason––the longer the time period, the less the influence of seasonal patterns in overhead costs, and

1.  The denominator reason––the longer the time period, the less the effect of variations in output levels or quantities of the cost-allocation bases on the allocation of fixed costs.

**
4-9** Actual costing and normal costing differ in their use of actual or budgeted indirect cost rates:

|                       |                |                  |
|-----------------------|----------------|------------------|
|                       | **Actual**     
                                         
                         **Costing**     | **Costing**      |
| Direct-cost rates     
 >                      
 > Indirect-cost rates  | Actual rates   
                         >               
                         > Actual rates  | Actual rates     
                                          >                 
                                          > Budgeted rates  |

Each costing method uses the actual quantity of the direct-cost input and the actual quantity of the cost-allocation base.

**4-10** A house construction firm can use job cost information (1) to determine the profitability of individual jobs, (2) to assist in bidding on future jobs, and (3) to evaluate professionals who are in charge of managing individual jobs.

**4-11** The statement is false. In a normal costing system, the Manufacturing Overhead Control account will not, in general, equal the amounts in the Manufacturing Overhead Allocated account. The Manufacturing Overhead Control account aggregates the actual overhead costs incurred while Manufacturing Overhead Allocated allocates overhead costs to jobs on the basis of a *budgeted rate* times the actual quantity of the cost-allocation base.

Underallocation or overallocation of indirect (overhead) costs can arise because of (1) the Numerator reason––the actual overhead costs differ from the budgeted overhead costs, or (2) the Denominator reason––the actual quantity used of the allocation base differs from the budgeted quantity.

**4-12** Debit entries to Work-in-Process Control represent increases in work in process. Examples of debit entries under normal costing are (1) direct materials used (credit to Materials Control), (2) direct manufacturing labor billed to job (credit to Wages Payable Control), and (3) manufacturing overhead allocated to job (credit to Manufacturing Overhead Allocated).

**4-13** Alternative ways to make end-of-period adjustments to dispose of underallocated or overallocated overhead are as follows:

> (i) Proration based on the total amount of indirect costs allocated (before proration) in the ending balances of work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold
>
> (ii) Proration based on total ending balances (before proration) in work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold

1.  Year-end write-off to Cost of Goods Sold

2.  The adjusted allocation rate approach that restates all overhead entries using actual indirect cost rates rather than budgeted indirect cost rates

**4-14** A company might use budgeted costs rather than actual costs to compute direct labor rates because it may be difficult to trace direct labor costs to jobs as they are completed (for example, because bonuses are only known at the end of the year).

**4-15** Modern technology of electronic data interchange (EDI) is helpful to managers because it ensures that a purchase order is transmitted quickly and accurately to suppliers with minimum paperwork and costs.

2. Costs of Job 626 under actual and normal costing follow:

**Actual **

**Costing Costing**

Direct materials $ 40,000 $ 40,000

Direct manufacturing labor costs 30,000 30,000

Manufacturing overhead costs

$30,000 × 1.90; $30,000 × 1.80 *57,000* *54,000*

Total manufacturing costs of Job 626 $127,000 $124,000

3. = ×

= $1,450,000 × 1.80

= $2,610,000

= –

= $2,755,000 − $2,610,000 = $145,000

There is no under- or overallocated overhead under actual costing because overhead is allocated under actual costing by multiplying actual manufacturing labor costs and the actual manufacturing overhead rate. This, of course, equals the actual manufacturing overhead costs. All actual overhead costs are allocated to products. Hence, there is no under- or overallocated overhead.

4. Managers at Destin Products might prefer to use normal costing because it enables them to use the budgeted manufacturing overhead rate determined at the beginning of the year to estimate the cost of a job as soon as the job is completed. Managers want to know job costs for ongoing uses, including pricing jobs, monitoring and managing costs, evaluating the success of the job, learning about what did and did not work, bidding on new jobs, and preparing interim financial statements. Under actual costing, managers would only determine the cost of a job at the end of the year when they know actual manufacturing overhead costs.

**4-18** (20 -30 min.) **Job costing, normal and actual costing.**

1. = =

= $50 per direct labor-hour

= =

= $47 per direct labor-hour

These rates differ because both the numerator and the denominator in the two calculations are different—one based on budgeted numbers and the other based on actual numbers.

3. Normal costing enables Anderson to report a job cost as soon as the job is completed, assuming that both the direct materials and direct labor costs are known at the time of use. Once the 920 direct labor-hours are known for the Laguna Model (June 2014), Anderson can compute the $188,926 cost figure using normal costing. Anderson can use this information to manage the costs of the Laguna Model job as well as to bid on similar jobs later in the year. In contrast, Anderson has to wait until the December 2014 year-end to compute the $186,166 cost of the Laguna Model using actual costing.

Although not required, the following overview diagram summarizes Anderson Construction’s job-costing system.

1. An overview of the product costing system is

Budgeted manufacturing overhead divided by allocation base:

Machining Department overhead: = $36 per machine-hour

Assembly Department overhead: = 180% of direct manuf. labor costs

2. Machining department overhead allocated, 2,000 hours × $36 $72,000

Assembly department overhead allocated, 180% × $15,000 *27,000*

Total manufacturing overhead allocated to Job 494 $99,000

3. **Machining Dept. Assembly Dept.**

Actual manufacturing overhead $2,100,000 $ 3,700,000

Manufacturing overhead allocated,

1. Budgeted indirect-cost rate for client support can be calculated as follows:

> Budgeted indirect-cost rate = $13,000,000 ÷ $5,000,000 = 260% of professional labor costs

![](./media/image25.wmf)

1.  At the budgeted revenues of $20,000,000 Taylor’s operating income of $2,000,000 equals 10% of revenues.

Markup rate = $20,000,000 ÷ $5,000,000 = 400% of direct professional labor costs

3. Budgeted costs

Direct costs:

> Director, $200 × 3 $ 600
>
> Partner, $100 × 16 1,600
>
> Associate, $50 × 40 2,000
>
> Assistant, $30 × 160 *4,800* $ 9,000
>
> Indirect costs:
>
> Consulting support, 260% × $9,000 *23,400*
>
> Total costs $32,400

As calculated in requirement 2, the bid price to earn a 10% income-to-revenue margin is 400% of direct professional costs. Therefore, Taylor should bid 4 × $9,000 = $36,000 for the Tasty Chicken job.

Bid price to earn target operating income-to-revenue margin of 10% can also be calculated as follows:

Let R = revenue to earn target income

R – 0.10R = $32,400

0.90R = $32,400

R = $32,400 ÷ 0.90 = $36,000

Or

Direct costs $ 9,000

Indirect costs 23,400

Operating income (0.10 × $36,000) *3,600*

Bid price $36,000

Socha might be seeing large fluctuations in the prices of its pools because Plunge is determining budgeted manufacturing overhead rates on a quarterly rather than an annual basis. Plunge should use the budgeted annual manufacturing overhead rate because capacity decisions are based on longer annual periods rather than quarterly periods. Prices should not vary based on quarterly fluctuations in production. Plunge could vary prices based on market conditions and demand for its pools. In this case, Plunge would charge higher prices in quarter 2 when demand for its pools is high. Pricing based on quarterly budgets would cause Plunge to do the opposite—to decrease rather than increase prices!

**4-23** (10–15 min.) **Accounting for manufacturing overhead.**

1. Budgeted manufacturing overhead rate =

= $22 per direct labor-hour

2. Work-in-Process Control 4,664,000

Manufacturing Overhead Allocated 4,664,000

(212,000 direct labor-hours × $22 per direct labor-hour = $4,664,000)

3. $4,650,000– $4,664,000 = $74,000 overallocated, an insignificant amount of difference compared to manufacturing overhead costs allocated $14,000 ÷ $4,664,000 = 0.3%. If the quantities of work-in-process and finished goods inventories are small, the difference between proration and write off to Cost of Goods Sold account would be very small compared to net income.

Manufacturing Overhead Allocated 4,664,000

Manufacturing Department Overhead Control 4.650,000

Cost of Goods Sold 14,000

This answer assumes COGS given of $4,020 does not include the writeoff of overallocated manufacturing overhead.

4. Gross margin = Revenues Cost of goods sold = $8,000 $3,890 = $4,110. This is a very good profit margin of 51% ($4,110 ÷ $8,000) indicating that University of Chicago Press performed very well in 2014. (Gross margins above 30% are generally considered very good.) It also accurately budgeted for manufacturing overhead costs resulting in a very small overallocation.

Entry posted to T-accounts in Requirement 2.

4. Gross margin = Revenues − Cost of goods sold = $410 − $295 = $115.

Donald Transport’s gross margin of 28% ($115 ÷ $410) is relatively small, indicating Donald Transport did fine but not particularly well in 2014. (Gross margins below 30% are generally considered small.) A company manufacturing prestige manufactured homes should have higher gross margins.

1.  Cheney & Partners should choose a job-costing system based on the direct cost information available to them. If Cheney knows direct costs as the jobs are being done, I would recommend Cheney use normal costing over actual costing by calculating a budgeted indirect cost rate to cost jobs. Normal costing enables Cheney to use the budgeted indirect cost rate calculated at the beginning of the year to estimate the cost of a job as soon as the job is completed. Cheney can use knowledge of job costs for ongoing uses, including pricing jobs, monitoring and managing costs, evaluating the success of the job, learning about what did and did not work, bidding on new jobs, and preparing interim financial statements. Under actual costing, Cheney would only determine the cost of a job at the end of the year when actual indirect costs are known. To be useful, of course, the budgeted indirect cost rate and the allocated costs need to reasonably approximate the actual indirect cost rate and the actual costs.

If Cheney does not know direct costs as the jobs are being completed, I would recommend that Cheney use the variation of normal costing that calculates a budgeted direct cost rate. This would allow Cheney to estimate costs on a more-timely basis and gain all the benefits discussed earlier in the context of indirect costs. However, if Cheney does use the variation of normal costing, it needs to do a better job of estimating the budgeted direct cost rate. Currently, the budgeted direct cost rate ($60) is much greater than the actual rate of $53 per professional labor hour. If the difference is too large, the budgeted costs allocated to jobs will not approximate the actual costs incurred.

All three costing systems use the actual professional labor time of 185 hours. The budgeted 170 hours for the Pierre Enterprises audit job is not used in job costing. However, Cheney may have used the 170 hour number in bidding for the audit.

The actual costing figure of $18,685 is greater than the normal costing figure of $18,130 because the actual indirect-cost rate ($48) is more than the budgeted indirect-cost rate ($45). The normal costing figure of $18,130 is less than the variation of normal costing (based on budgeted rates for direct costs) figure of $19,425 because the actual direct-cost rate ($53) is less than the budgeted direct-cost rate ($60).

Although not required, the following overview diagram summarizes Cheney’s job-costing system.

1.  Creative Solutions should choose a job-costing system based on the direct cost information available to them. If Creative Solutions knows direct costs as the jobs are being done, I would recommend Creative Solutions use normal costing over actual costing by calculating a budgeted indirect cost rate to cost jobs. Normal costing enables Creative Solutions to use the budgeted indirect cost rate calculated at the beginning of the year to estimate the cost of a job as soon as the job is completed. Creative Solutions can use knowledge of job costs for ongoing uses, including pricing jobs, monitoring and managing costs, evaluating the success of the job, learning about what did and did not work, bidding on new jobs, and preparing interim financial statements. Under actual costing, Creative Solutions would only determine the cost of a job at the end of the year when actual indirect costs are known. To be useful, of course, the budgeted indirect cost rate and the allocated costs need to reasonably approximate the actual indirect cost rate and the actual costs.

If Creative Solutions does not know direct costs as the jobs are being completed, I would recommend that Creative Solutions use the variation of normal costing that calculates a budgeted direct cost rate. This would allow Creative Solutions to estimate costs on a more-timely basis and gain all the benefits discussed earlier in the context of indirect costs. However, if Creative Solutions does use the variation of normal costing, it needs to continue to do a good job of estimating the budgeted direct cost rate. Currently, the budgeted direct cost rate ($26) is very close to the actual rate of $25 per direct labor-hour.

4. Writing off all of the underallocated manufacturing overhead to Cost of Goods Sold (CGS) is usually warranted when CGS is large relative to Work-in-Process and Finished Goods Inventory and the underallocated manufacturing overhead is immaterial. Both these conditions apply in this case. ROW should write off the $3,000 underallocated manufacturing overhead to Cost of Goods Sold Account.

4-31** (20−30 min) **Job costing, accounting for manufacturing overhead, budgeted rates.**

1. An overview of the job-costing system is:

2. Budgeted manufacturing overhead divided by allocation base:

> a. Machining Department:
>
> = $49 per machine-hour

1.  Finishing Department:

> = 202% of direct manufacturing labor costs

3. Machining Department overhead, $49 × 140 machine-hours $6,860

Finishing Department overhead, 202% of $1,250 *2,525*

Total manufacturing overhead allocated $9,385

4. Total costs of Job 431:

Direct costs:

Direct materials––Machining Department $13,000

––Finishing Department 5,000

Direct manufacturing labor —Machining Department 900

—Finishing Department *1,250* $20,150

Indirect costs:

Machining Department overhead, $49 × 140 $ 6,860

Finishing Department overhead, 202% of $1,250 *2,525* *9,385*

Total costs $29,535

The per-unit product cost of Job 431 is $29,535 ÷ 300 units = $98.45 per unit

The point of this part is (a) to get the definitions straight and (b) to underscore that overhead is allocated by multiplying the actual amount of the allocation base by the budgeted rate.

5.

> **Machining Finishing**
>
> Manufacturing overhead incurred (actual) $10,000,000 $7,982,000

>
> Overallocated manufacturing overhead $ 300,000

Total overallocated overhead = $300,000 – $200,000 = $100,000

1.  A homogeneous cost pool is one where all costs have the same or a similar cause-and-effect or benefits-received relationship with the cost-allocation base. Pisano likely assumes that all its manufacturing overhead cost items are not homogeneous. Specifically, those in the Machining Department have a cause-and-effect relationship with machine-hours, while those in the Finishing Department have a cause-and-effect relationship with direct manufacturing labor costs. Pisano believes that the benefits of using two cost pools (more accurate product costs and better ability to manage costs) exceed the costs of implementing a more complex system.

The Richardson and Punch jobs differ in their use of resources. The Richardson job has a mix of 40% partners and 60% associates, while Punch has a mix of 20% partners and 80% associates. Thus, the job is a relatively high user of the more costly partner-related resources (both direct partner costs and indirect partner secretarial support). The Punch job, on the other hand, has a mix of partner and associate-related hours (1:4) that is only slightly higher than the mix of partner and associate hours for the firm as a whole (1:5). The refined-costing system in Problem 4-33 increases the reported cost in Problem 4-32 for the Richardson job by 29.17% (from $14,400 to $18,600) and the Punch job by a much smaller 4.17% (from $19,200 to $20,000).

5. I would recommend that Kidman & Associates use the job costing system in this problem with two direct- and two indirect- cost categories.

Kidman & Associates should use multiple categories of direct costs (partner labor and professional labor) because the costs of the different categories of labor are very different and different jobs use these direct labor resources in different proportions. The system with only one direct cost would be accurate only if all jobs used partner-labor and professional-labor in the same proportion, which is clearly not the case. Using a single direct-cost category would undercost (overcost) jobs that have a high (low) proportion of partner-labor.

Kidman should use multiple indirect cost pools because partners use additional secretarial support resources that professionals do not use. With a single indirect cost pool as in problem 4-32, jobs that use proportionately greater (fewer) partner labor-hours are not assigned the extra (lower) costs of supporting these partners and are undercosted (overcosted).

The job costing system in this problem more accurately represents the costs incurred on different jobs and therefore helps managers make better decisions.

3. Alternative (c) is theoretically preferred over (a) and (b) because the underallocated amount and the balances in work-in-process and finished goods inventories are material. Alternative (c) yields the same ending balances in work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold that would have been reported had actual indirect cost rates been used.

Chapter 4 also discusses an adjusted allocation rate approach that results in the same ending balances as does alternative (c). This approach operates via a restatement of the indirect costs allocated to all the individual jobs worked on during the year using the actual indirect cost rate.

**4-35** (15 min.) **Normal costing, overhead allocation, working backward.**

Because Premier Golf Carts is disposing of underallocated costs based on the ending balance in Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold accounts, it does not have to allocate the underallocated overhead from each department separately. Had Premier Golf Carts disposed of the underallocated overhead based on the overhead allocated in the ending balances in each of the three accounts, it would have to dispose of the underallocated overhead in the Fabrication Department and the underallocated overhead in the Finishing Department separately.

4. The ending balance in Cost of Goods Sold would be $312,500 instead of $307,500 if the entire $12,500 amount of underallocated overhead was written off to Cost of Goods Sold account. Cost of Goods Sold would increase by 1.6% ($312,500 – $307,500) ÷ $307,500. Because this is an insignificant amount, it would be reasonable to use the simpler method of charging off to Cost of Goods Sold.

1. From Direct Materials Control T-account,

Direct materials issued to production = $234,000 that appears as a credit.

2. Direct manufacturing labor-hours = ![](./media/image95.wmf)

= ![](./media/image96.emf)= 29,000 hours

![](./media/image97.wmf) = ![](./media/image98.wmf) × ![](./media/image99.wmf)

= 29,000 hours × $16 per hour = $464,000

3. From the debit entry to Finished Goods T-account,

Cost of jobs completed and transferred from WIP = $925,000

4. From Work-in-Process T-account,

= $44,000 + $234,000 + $348,000 + $464,000 –$925,000

= $165,000

5. From the credit entry to Finished Goods Control T-account, Cost of goods sold (before proration) = $880,000

6. ![](./media/image100.wmf) = ![](./media/image101.wmf) – ![](./media/image102.wmf)

**=** $514,000 – $464,000

= $50,000 underallocated

7. a. Write-off to Cost of Goods Sold will increase (debit) Cost of Goods Sold by $50,000. Hence, Cost of Goods Sold = $880,000 + $50,000 = $930,000.

b. Proration based on ending balances (before proration) in Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold.

8. ’s operating income using write-off to Cost of Goods Sold and Proration based on ending balances (before proration) follows:

**Write-off to Proration Based**

> **Cost of Goods Sold on Ending Balances**
>
> Revenues $1,050,000 $1,050,000
>
> Cost of goods sold *930,000* *920,000*
>
> Gross margin 120,000 130,000
>
> Marketing and distribution costs *125,000* *125,000*
>
> Operating income/(loss) $ (5,000) $ 5,000

9. If the purpose is to report the most accurate inventory and cost of goods sold figures, the preferred method is to prorate based on the manufacturing overhead allocated component in the inventory and cost of goods sold accounts. Proration based on the balances in Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold will equal the proration based on the manufacturing overhead allocated component if the proportions of direct costs to manufacturing overhead costs are constant in the Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold accounts. Even if this is not the case, the prorations based on Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold will better approximate the results if actual cost rates had been used rather than the write-off to Cost of Goods Sold method.

Another consideration in ’s decision about how to dispose of underallocated manufacturing overhead is the effects on operating income. The write-off to Cost of Goods Sold will lead to an operating loss. Proration based on the balances in Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold will help avoid the loss and show an operating income.

The main merit of the write-off to Cost of Goods Sold method is its simplicity. However, accuracy and the effect on operating income favor the preferred and recommended proration approach.

<sup>b</sup> Direct manufacturing labor and manufacturing overhead allocated are unknown. Let *x* = Direct manufacturing labor up to 12/30 payroll, then manufacturing overhead allocated up to 12/30 payroll = 1.10*x*

Use the T-account equation and solve for *x*:

$6,700 + $59,900 + *x* + 1.10*x* – $234,000 = $9,000

2.10*x* = $9,000 – $6,700 – $59,900 + $234,000 = $176,400

*x* =

Direct manufacturing labor up to 12/30 payroll = $84,000

Manufacturing overhead allocated up to 12/30 = 1.10 × $84,000 = $92,400

Total direct manufacturing labor for December = $84,000 + $4,300 (direct manufacturing labor for 12/31 calculated in requirement 1) = $88,300

Total manufacturing overhead allocated for December = $92,400 + $4,730<sup>c</sup> = $97,130

<sup>c</sup> $4,300 × 110% = $4,730, manufacturing overhead allocated on $4,300 of direct manufacturing labor incurred on 12/31.

(b) Total direct manufacturing labor for December = $88,300.

(c) Total manufacturing overhead allocated (recorded) in work in process equals $97,130.

(d) Ending balance in work-in-process inventory on December 31 equals $9,000 + $4,300 (direct manufacturing labor added on 12/31, requirement 1) + $4,730 (manufacturing overhead allocated on 12/31, requirement 1) = $18,030.

An alternative approach to solving requirements 2b, 2c, and 2d is to calculate the work-in-process inventory on December 31, recognizing that because no new units were started or completed, no direct materials were added and the direct manufacturing labor and manufacturing overhead allocated on December 31 were added to the work-in-process inventory balance of December 30.

5. Writing off all of the underallocated overhead to Cost of Goods Sold (CGS) is warranted when CGS is large relative to Work-in-Process Inventory and Finished Goods Inventory and the underallocated overhead is immaterial. Both these conditions apply in this case. InStep Company should write off the $3,200 underallocated overhead to Cost of Goods Sold account.

Direct materials = ($2,090,000/200) × 150 = $1,567,500

Direct manufacturing labor

Manufacturing overhead = (3.50 × $123,300) = $431,550

3. The main discrepancies in costs (before the mark up) in requirements 1 and 2 are as follows:

1.  Materials are marked up by 10% in the Sept. 15, 2014, invoice.
    ($1,567,500 – $1,425,000)/$1,425,000 = 10%.

2.  Costs are double-counted based on the Sept. 15, 2014, invoice (inspection and setup costs are included as both a direct cost as part of direct manufacturing labor and in manufacturing overhead allocated at 3.5 times direct manufacturing labor cost).

> c. The standard cost sheet includes 32 direct manufacturing labor hours, while the Sept. 15, 2014, invoice includes 30 hours of production labor.

4. According to the IMA *Standards of Ethical Conduct for Practitioners of Management Accounting and Financial Management*, the following principles should guide your decision to present the bid based on the retail cost of producing the huts:

1.  Competence—responsibility to provide information that is accurate.

2.  Integrity—refraining from engaging in any conduct that would prejudice carrying out duties ethically or that would discredit the profession.

3.  Credibility—disclose all relevant information.

> I would go to my boss with the bid in requirement 1 after checking
>
> > (a) If any direct material savings is possible and
>
> > (b) If direct manufacturing labor can be reduced to 30 hours from 32 hours.
>
> Assuming that only the latter is the case, then the bid I would propose is:

5. I would choose the method in 4b (proration based on overhead allocated) because this method results in account balances based on actual overhead allocation rates. The account balances before proration in GIP and CCG are significant, and underallocated overhead is material.

Of course, the method chosen affects reported operating income. In the case of underallocated overhead, writing off to CCG results in lower operating income compared to proration and lower taxes. If overhead had been overallocated, proration would result in lower operating income and lower taxes.

Despite the tax considerations, I would choose proration because it best represents Brady’s performance during a period. I would use the simpler method of write off to CCG only if the amount were immaterial or if it represents inefficiency. I would apply this method consistently from period to period.
