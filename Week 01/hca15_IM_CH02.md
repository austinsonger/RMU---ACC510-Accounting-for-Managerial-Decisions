> This chapter has been rewritten to place more emphasis on the role of managerial decisions. Exhibits have been changed so students can more easily follow the concepts. This chapter continues building on the framework begun in Chapter 1, emphasizing (1) calculating the cost of products or other cost objects, (2) obtaining information for planning and control as well as performance evaluation, and (3) identifying relevant information for decision making. It introduces concepts essential to topics covered in later chapters.

1.  **CHAPTER SYNOPSIS**

> Chapter 2 defines and explains important cost accounting terms and concepts that will be discussed in the following chapters. Understanding the concepts and terms discussed in this chapter is a prerequisite to successfully completing the remaining chapters of the text. One guiding principle is that the term **cost** is a relative term, dependent both on the *cost object* chosen and the *purpose* for which cost is being calculated and reported.
>
> Costs are a critical element in most business decisions. Students also need to recognize that companies pay particular attention to costs because every dollar in cost reduction is one more dollar of **operating income,** whereas one more dollar of sales does not necessarily result in the same impact due to the additional costs that may be incurred in generating those sales.
>
> *Cost* is often actually “estimated cost” due to difficulties involved in cost tracing and allocation, relevant range issues, which cost method is used, and the cost-benefit approach to measuring costs. Although there are certain standard costing and reporting methods followed by all, companies calculate and report the same types of data differently depending on their industry and sector. Companies commonly operate in the merchandising, manufacturing, and service sectors.

**III. Points of Emphasis**

1.  Although terminology can be boring, it is important that the students grasp and understand the terms introduced in this chapter. They will have some familiarity with some of the terms; however, remind them that these words may have meanings that are different in a cost accounting context.

2.  The distinction between inventoriable (or product) cost and period cost is an important one that students may have some trouble grasping, as they are accustomed to treating items such as wages, rent, utilities, and the like as expenses of the period. Likewise, the term *conversion cost* is one that should be mastered early on.

**IV. CHAPTER OUTLINE**

> Teaching point. Knowledge of the terminology in this chapter is important for the student to gain an understanding of the concepts covered in the course. In teaching the material in the chapter, it is very beneficial to repeatedly ask questions such as: (1) What is the cost object in the situation? (2) What costs can be traced? and (3) Which costs are allocated?

| **LEARNING **

1.  **Cost** is a resource sacrificed or forgone to achieve a specific objective.

2.  **Actual cost** is the historical amount, or cost incurred, as distinguished from **budgeted cost,** which is the predicted or forecasted (future) amount of cost.

3.  **Cost object** is anything for which a measurement of cost is desired. Stated another way, the cost object is anything for which a measurement of costs is desired. For example, this can be a product, an assembly line, a product line, or a department.

> Teaching point. Discuss with the students the concept of cost object. Use different examples of cost objects. Help them relate the concept to their own lives. The cost of taking a trip during spring break, the cost of a date, the cost of a college education, and the cost of a single class—all make good talking points.
>
> (Exhibit 2-1 illustrates examples of cost objects at BMW.)

1.  **Cost accumulation** is the collection of cost data in some organized manner by means of an accounting system. Following accumulation, costs are assigned to the chosen cost object.

2.  The process of **cost assignment** involves **tracing** and **allocating** costs, depending on the type of cost involved.

> <span id="OLE_LINK1" class="anchor"></span>2.1 **Direct costs of a cost object** are costs that are related to the cost object and can be traced to it in an economically feasible (cost effective) way. It is possible to trace costs to the cost object, but it is not always practical to do so from a cost-benefit perspective. **Cost tracing** is the process of assigning costs to a cost object.
>
> 2.2 Direct cost categories include **direct materials** and **direct manufacturing labor.** Direct materials are materials that go into the production of the product. Direct labor is the wages paid to workers who spend time working on the product.
>
> 2.3 **Indirect costs of a cost object** are related to the cost object but cannot be traced in an economically feasible way. These costs are frequently referred to as factory overhead, manufacturing overhead, or some similar term. These costs include supervisor salaries, supplies, or other costs incurred in the factory that are not direct materials or direct labor. Indirect costs are assigned to a cost object by **allocation.**
>
> Teaching point. Make the observation that the same cost may be direct or indirect depending on the cost object. Use some illustrations. For example, a line supervisor in a factory could be a direct cost if the cost object were the particular assembly line, but would be indirect if the finished product is the cost object.
>
> 2.4 **Cost assignment** includes tracing direct costs and allocating indirect costs.
>
> 2.5 Accurate cost allocation can be a challenging task depending on the type of cost involved. For example, management may find it difficult to allocate administrative costs to cash product manufactured.
>
> 2.6 There are several factors that affect the classification of costs as direct or indirect. Three of these factors include:

-   **Materiality of the cost.** The smaller the amount of the cost, the less likely that it is economically feasible to trace that cost to a particular cost object.

<!-- -->

-   **Available information gathering technology.** For example, bar-code technology has made it possible to trace just about any raw material used in the manufacturing process.

<!-- -->

-   **Design of operations.** A cost used exclusively for a specific cost object can be readily traced.

> (Exhibit 2-2 illustrates the assignment of direct and indirect costs at BMW.)
>
> Teaching point. Use an object in the classroom, such as a stool or chair. Place it on a desk or somewhere the students can easily see it. Ask: “What are the materials used in manufacturing the object?” Once a list of materials is compiled, then have the students determine which are direct material costs and which are indirect costs.

|                                              |

> 3.1 Management must understand cost behavior in order to adequately predict costs. From a behavioral view, costs are classified as **fixed** or **variable.**
>
> 3.2 A **variable cost** changes in total in proportion to changes in the activity level. For example, if the number of units produced doubles, direct materials (a variable cost) would double in total. Note, however, that the variable cost per unit remains constant.
>
> 3.3 **Total fixed costs** do not change with changes in the activity level. If units produced doubles, total fixed costs remain the same. However, when expressed on a per-unit basis, fixed costs would change with an increase in activity.
>
> (Exhibit 2-3 displays the cost behavior of variable and fixed costs in total.)
>
> 3.4 Costs are not inherently fixed or variable; cost behavior depends on the defined cost object. They may be variable with respect to level of activity and fixed for another.
>
> 3.5 A **cost driver** is a variable, such as the level or activity or volume that causally affects costs over a given span of time. Stated another way, there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the level of activity of the cost driver and the cost incurred.
>
> Teaching point. Use several examples that will help the students grasp this concept. For example, their cost of gasoline is determined largely by the number of miles driven. This can also be used to illustrate that most costs, in reality, have multiple drivers. Gas cost is also affected by type of driving, the horsepower of the engine, and other factors.
>
> 3.6 **Relevant range** is the range of activity within which costs behave as predicted. Outside this level of activity, costs behave differently. This is not a concept that can be determined from a textbook; observation of the actual costs must be done in order to determine this range.
>
> (Exhibit 2-4 illustrates the relevant range of fixed costs at Thomas Transport Company.)
>
> 3.7 In dealing with costs, it is important to distinguish between behaviors of costs when expressed as unit costs and when dealing with total costs. Generally, decision makers should think in terms of total cost. However, in many decision analysis situations, calculating unit costs is essential.

> 4.1 Unit costs (also called average costs) are calculated by dividing total costs incurred by the number of units produced and are normally used in making decisions such as product mix and pricing. However, managers should usually think in terms of total costs for most decisions.
>
> 4.2 Fixed costs, when expressed on a unit basis can be misleading. For example, if fixed costs are $25,000 and you manufacture 5,000 units, fixed costs are $5 per unit. When production increases to 6,250 units, total fixed costs remain at $25,000, but the unit cost declines to $4. Avoid using the higher unit cost when production level changes.

> 5.1 **Manufacturing-sector companies** purchase materials and components and convert them into finished goods.
>
> 5.2 **Merchandising-sector companies** purchase and sell tangible products without changing their basis form. These companies are known as retailers, wholesalers, and distributors.
>
> 5.3 **Service-sector companies** provide services (intangibles). However, there is frequently a tangible aspect to the service.
>
> Teaching point. Have the students name companies that are representative of each sector. Likely, they will correctly identify the proper sector for each company. Point out, however, that a service company may have a tangible aspect, such as the tax return as the end product of a tax preparation service. Conversely, a merchandising company may emphasize the intangibles. As the saying goes, “sell the sizzle, not the steak.”

**Refer to Quiz Question 5**

> 5.4 The accounting system of a manufacturing company is more complex than for a merchandising or service company. The principal reason for this complexity is in the inventories held by a manufacturer. These companies will have three types of inventory.

-   **Direct materials inventory,** or simply materials inventory, consists of materials being held by the company, ready to be used in the manufacturing process.

-   **Work-in-process inventory** represents product partially worked on but not yet completed. WIP is a representation of what is on the factory floor.

-   **Finished goods inventory** is goods that have not yet been sold.

> 5.5 Merchandising companies purchase products in their completed form and do not make changes in their basic form. An inventory account for a merchandising company is called *merchandise inventory,* or simply *inventory.*
>
> 5.6 The work-in-process account will have three debits, representing the three types of manufacturing costs.

-   **Direct material costs** are the costs of materials that become part of the cost object and can be traced to the cost object in an economically feasible manner.

-   **Direct manufacturing labor costs** include compensation of manufacturing labor that can be traced to the cost object in an economically feasible manner. This includes labor of workers who work converting direct materials into finished goods.

-   **Indirect manufacturing costs** are all manufacturing costs that are related to the cost object but can’t be traced to that object in an economically feasible manner. These costs are allocated rather than traced. Other terms for this category include **manufacturing overhead** or **factory overhead costs.**

**Refer to Quiz Question 6**

> 5.7 **Inventoriable costs** are all costs of a product that are considered assets on the balance sheet when they are incurred and include direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead. They become a part of the cost of the product and are assets until sold, when they become cost of goods sold. These are also known as **product costs.**
>
> 5.8 **Period costs** are all costs on the income statement other than cost of goods sold. Period costs are treated as expenses of the period in which they are incurred.
>
> (Exhibit 2-6 illustrates examples of period costs in a bank.)

> 6.1 Manufacturing costs of completed products include direct material, direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs. These costs are recorded on the balance sheet as inventory until the product is sold. Exhibit 2-7 provides an illustration depicting how product costs in a manufacturing setting flow through the financial statements.
>
> TEACHING POINT. Point out to students that the inventoriable product costs are included on the balance sheet in direct material inventory, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods inventory and that period costs are expensed on the income statement. Emphasize that product costs stay on the balance sheet until the product is sold. At the point of sale, product costs are expensed on the income statement as cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2-9 presents the product cost flow in a
> t-account format.
>
> 6.2 Exhibit 2-8 provides an illustration of the cost of goods manufactured statement.
>
> TEACHING POINT. Walk students through the calculation of cost of goods manufactured, cost of goods sold and operating income using the information provided in Exhibit 2-7.
>
> 6.3 **Prime cost** is a term used to describe all direct costs or direct materials plus direct labor.
>
> 6.4 **Conversion cost** is direct labor plus factory overhead. It is the cost of converting the materials into a finished product.
>
> Teaching point. Many companies with highly automated manufacturing operations have little or no direct labor. These companies often have only one prime cost (DM) and one conversion cost (DL).

> Teaching point. Labor costs can include only the wage paid to the workers or it can be broadened to include the cost of that labor to the employer—the wage rate plus the cost of benefits the employee receives. Overtime premium can be treated as direct labor or as overhead.
>
> 7.2 When measuring labor costs, two issues in cost measurement that require special attention are **idle time** and **overtime premium.** Idle time is wage paid for unproductive time caused by lack of orders, machine breakdowns, or other reasons. Overtime premium is the wage rate paid to workers in excess of their regular straight-time wage rate. Both of these are considered as overhead rather than direct labor costs.

> 8.1 This chapter deals with a number of cost terms and purposes. These concepts can be expressed in three features of cost accounting that have a wide range of uses in business applications.

-   **Calculating the cost of products, services, and other cost objects.** Managers use this information in a variety of ways to formulate strategy and make various decisions, such as pricing, product mix, and cost management.

-   **Obtaining information for planning and control and for performance evaluation.** Budgeting is the most commonly used tool for planning and control and forces managers to:

<!-- -->

-   Look ahead

-   Translate strategy into plans

-   Coordinate and communicate within the organization

-   Provide a benchmark for evaluating performance

    -   **Analyzing the relevant information for making decisions.** Managers must understand which revenues and costs to consider and which to ignore in the decision-making process. Management accounting can assist managers in determining which information is relevant.
