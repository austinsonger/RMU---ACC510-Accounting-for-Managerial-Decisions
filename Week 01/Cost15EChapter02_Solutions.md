**CHAPTER 2**

**AN INTRODUCTION TO COST TERMS AND PURPOSES**

**2-1** A *cost object* is anything for which a separate measurement of costs is desired. Examples include a product, a service, a project, a customer, a brand category, an activity, and a department.

**2-2** Direct costs of a cost object are related to the particular cost object and can be traced to that cost object in an economically feasible (cost-effective) way.

Indirect costs of a cost object are related to the particular cost object but cannot be traced to that cost object in an economically feasible (cost-effective) way.

Cost assignment is a general term that encompasses the assignment of both direct costs and indirect costs to a cost object. Direct costs are *traced* to a cost object, while indirect costs are *allocated* to a cost object.

**2-3** Managers believe that direct costs that are traced to a particular cost object are more accurately assigned to that cost object than are indirect allocated costs. When costs are allocated, managers are less certain whether the cost allocation base accurately measures the resources demanded by a cost object. Managers prefer to use more accurate costs in their decisions.

1.  Factors affecting the classification of a cost as direct or indirect include

-   the materiality of the cost in question

-   available information-gathering technology

-   design of operations

    1.  A *variable cost* changes in total in proportion to changes in the related level of total activity or volume. An example is a sales commission that is a percentage of each sales revenue dollar.

A *fixed cost* remains unchanged in total for a given time period, despite wide changes in the related level of total activity or volume. An example is the leasing cost of a machine that is unchanged for a given time period (such as a year) regardless of the number of units of product produced on the machine.

**2-6** A *cost driver* is a variable, such as the level of activity or volume, that causally affects total costs over a given time span. A change in the cost driver results in a change in the level of total costs. For example, the number of vehicles assembled is a driver of the costs of steering wheels on a motor-vehicle assembly line.

**2-7** The *relevant range* is the band of normal activity level or volume in which there is a specific relationship between the level of activity or volume and the cost in question. Costs are described as variable or fixed with respect to a particular relevant range.

**2-8** A unit cost is computed by dividing some amount of total costs (the numerator) by the related number of units (the denominator). In many cases, the numerator will include a fixed cost that will not change despite changes in the denominator. It is erroneous in those cases to multiply the unit cost by activity or volume change to predict changes in total costs at different activity or volume levels.

**2-9** *Manufacturing-sector companies* purchase materials and components and convert them into various finished goods, for example automotive and textile companies.

*Merchandising-sector companies* purchase and then sell tangible products without changing their basic form, for example retailing or distribution.

*Service-sector companies* provide services or intangible products to their customers, for example, legal advice or audits.

1.  Manufacturing companies have one or more of the following three types of inventory:

<!-- -->

1.  *Direct materials inventory*. Direct materials in stock and awaiting use in the manufacturing process.

2.  *Work-in-process inventory*. Goods partially worked on but not yet completed. Also called *work in progress***.**

3.  *Finished goods inventory*. Goods completed but not yet sold.

    1.  *Inventoriable costs* are all costs of a product that are considered as assets in the balance sheet when they are incurred and that become cost of goods sold when the product is sold. These costs are included in work-in-process and finished goods inventory (they are “inventoried”) to accumulate the costs of creating these assets.

*Period costs* are all costs in the income statement other than cost of goods sold. These costs are treated as expenses of the accounting period in which they are incurred because they are expected not to benefit future periods (because there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that such benefit exists). Expensing these costs immediately best matches expenses to revenues.

**2-12** *Direct material costs* are the acquisition costs of all materials that eventually become part of the cost object (work in process and then finished goods) and can be traced to the cost object in an economically feasible way.

*Direct manufacturing labor costs* include the compensation of all manufacturing labor that can be traced to the cost object (work in process and then finished goods) in an economically feasible way.

*Manufacturing overhead costs* are all manufacturing costs that are related to the cost object (work in process and then finished goods) but cannot be traced to that cost object in an economically feasible way.

*Prime costs* are all direct manufacturing costs (direct material and direct manufacturing labor).

*Conversion costs* are all manufacturing costs other than direct material costs.

**2-13** *Overtime premium* is the wage rate paid to workers (for both direct labor and indirect labor) in excess of their straight-time wage rates.

*Idle time* is a subclassification of indirect labor that represents wages paid for unproductive time caused by lack of orders, machine breakdowns, material shortages, poor scheduling, and the like.

**2-14** A product cost is the sum of the costs assigned to a product for a specific purpose. Purposes for computing a product cost include

-   pricing and product mix decisions,

-   contracting with government agencies, and

-   preparing financial statements for external reporting under GAAP.

**2-15** Three common features of cost accounting and cost management are

-   calculating the costs of products, services, and other cost objects

-   obtaining information for planning and control and performance evaluation

-   analyzing the relevant information for making decisions

The total manufacturing cost per unit in requirement 1 includes $15 million of indirect manufacturing costs that are fixed irrespective of changes in the volume of output per month, while the remaining variable indirect manufacturing costs change with the production volume. Given the unit volume changes for August 2014, the use of total manufacturing cost per unit from the past month at a different unit volume level (both in aggregate and at the individual product level) will overestimate total costs of $532.09 million in August 2014 relative to the correct total manufacturing costs of $527.69 million calculated using variable manufacturing cost per unit times units produced plus the fixed costs of $15 million.

2. If the cost object is Mixing Department, then anything directly associated with the Mixing Department will be a direct cost. This will include:

-   Depreciation on mixing machines

-   Mixing Department manager

-   Materials handlers (of the Mixing Department)

-   Machinist (running the mixing machines)

-   Machine Maintenance personnel (of the Mixing Department)

-   Maintenance supplies (if separately identified for the Mixing Department)

Of course the yeast and flour will also be a direct cost of the Mixing Department, but it is already a direct cost of each kind of bread produced.**

2. In each region, Ashton chooses the plan that has the lowest cost. From the graph (or from calculations)\*, we can see that if Ashton expects to use 0–150 minutes of long-distance each month, she buy Plan A; for 150–327.5 minutes, Plan B; and for more than 327.5 minutes, Plan C. If Ashton plans to make 100 minutes of long-distance calls each month, she choose Plan A; for 240 minutes, choose Plan B; for 540 minutes, choose Plan C.

0 to 100 surfers per month = $100,000 + $150,000 + $50,000 = $300,000

101 to 200 surfers per month = $100,000 + $150,000 + $74,500 = $324,500

More than 200 surfers per month = $100,000 + $150,000 + $200,000 = $450,000

![](./media/image6.jpeg)

The concept of relevant range is potentially relevant for both graphs. However, the question does not place restrictions on the unit variable costs. The relevant range for the total fixed costs is from 0 to 100 surfers; 101 to 200 surfers; more than 200 surfers. Within these ranges, the total fixed costs do not change in total.

The unit cost for 100 vehicles produced per month is $5,825, while for 225 vehicles it is only $4,825. This difference is caused by the fixed cost increment of $150,000 (an increase of 50%, $150,000 ÷ $300,000 = 50%) being spread over an increment of 125 (225 – 100) vehicles (an increase of 125%, 125 ÷ 100). The fixed cost per unit is therefore lower.

**2-23** (20 min.) **Variable costs, fixed costs, relevant range.**

1. The production capacity is 4,400 jaw breakers per month. Therefore, the current annual relevant range of output is 0 to 4,400 jaw breakers × 12 months = 0 to 52,800 jaw breakers.

2. Current annual fixed manufacturing costs within the relevant range are $1,300 × 12 = $15,600 for rent and other overhead costs, plus $9,500 ÷ 10 = $950 for depreciation, totaling $16,550.

The variable costs, the materials, are 10 cents per jaw breaker, or $3,720 ($0.10 per jaw breaker × 3,100 jaw breakers per month × 12 months) for the year.

3. If demand changes from 3,100 to 6,200 jaw breakers per month, or from 3,100 × 12 = 37,200 to 6,200 × 12 = 74,400 jaw breakers per year, Sweetum will need a second machine. Assuming Sweetum buys a second machine identical to the first machine, it will increase capacity from 4,400 jaw breakers per month to 8,800. The annual relevant range will be between 4,400 × 12 = 52,800 and 8,800 × 12 = 105,600 jaw breakers.

Assume the second machine costs $9,500 and is depreciated using straight-line depreciation over 10 years and zero residual value, just like the first machine. This will add $950 of depreciation per year.

Fixed costs for next year will increase to $17,500 from $16,550 for the current year + $950 (because rent and other fixed overhead costs will remain the same at $15,600). That is, total fixed costs for next year equal $950 (depreciation on first machine) + $950 (depreciation on second machine) + $15,600 (rent and other fixed overhead costs).

The variable cost per jaw breaker next year will be 90% × $0.10 = $0.09. Total variable costs equal $0.09 per jaw breaker × 74,400 jaw breakers = $6,696.

If Sweetum decides not to increase capacity and meet only that amount of demand for which it has available capacity (4,400 jaw breakers per month or 4,400 × 12 = 52,800 jaw breakers per year), the variable cost per unit will be the same at $0.10 per jaw breaker. Annual total variable manufacturing costs will increase to $0.10 × 4,400 jaw breakers per month × 12 months = $5,280. Annual total fixed manufacturing costs will remain the same, $16,550.

As shown in the table above, for 150 attendees the total cost will be $25,250, and the cost per attendee will be $168.33.

1.  As shown in the table in requirement 2, for 200 attendees, the total cost will be $29,000, and the cost per attendee will be $145.

2.  TBE should charge customers based on the number of guests. As the number of guests increase, TBE could offer price discounts because its fixed costs would be spread over a larger number of guests.

Alternatively, TBE could charge a flat fee of $10,000 plus a margin for the music. The catering costs would then vary less with the number of guests because only $4,000 of fixed costs would be spread over the number of guests. For 100 guests, the fixed catering cost per guest would be $40 ($4,000 ÷ 100 guests); for 200 guests, it would be $20 ($4,000 ÷ 200 guests). TBE’s total cost would be $115 (variable cost per guest of $75 + fixed catering cost per guest of $40) for 100 guests and $95 (variable cost per guest of $75 + fixed catering cost per guest of $20) for 200 guests.

**2-27** (25 min.) **Total and unit cost, decision making.**

1.

Note that the production costs include the $28,000 of fixed manufacturing costs but not the $10,000 of period costs. The variable cost is $1 per flange for materials, and $2.80 per flange ($28 per hour divided by 10 flanges per hour) for direct manufacturing labor for a total of $3.80 per flange.

2. The inventoriable (manufacturing) cost per unit for 5,000 flanges is

$3.80 × 5,000 + $28,000 = $47,000

Average (unit) cost = $47,000 ÷ 5,000 units = $9.40 per unit.

This is below Flora’s selling price of $10 per flange. However, in order to make a profit, Gayle’s Glassworks also needs to cover the period (non-manufacturing) costs of $10,000, or $10,000 ÷ 5,000 = $2 per unit.

Thus total costs, both inventoriable (manufacturing) and period (non-manufacturing), for the flanges is $9.40 + $2 = $11.40. Gayle’s Glassworks cannot sell below Flora’s price of $10 and still make a profit on the flanges.

Alternatively,

At Flora’s price of $10 per flange:

| Revenue        | $10   | ×   | 5,000 | =   | $50,000   |
|----------------|-------|-----|-------|-----|-----------|
| Variable costs | $3.80 | ×   | 5,000 | =   | 19,000    |
| Fixed costs    |       |     |       |     | *38,000*  |
| Operating loss |       |     |       |     | $ (7,000) |

Gayle’s Glassworks cannot sell below $10 per flange and make a profit. At Flora’s price of $10 per flange, the company has an operating loss of $7,000.

3. If Gayle’s Glassworks produces 10,000 units, then total inventoriable cost will be:

Variable cost ($3.80 × 10,000) + fixed manufacturing costs, $28,000 = total manufacturing costs, $66,000.

Unit total cost including both inventoriable and period costs will be

($66,000 + $10,000) ÷ 10,000 = $7.60 per flange, and Gayle’s Glassworks will be able to sell the flanges for less than Flora and still make a profit.

Alternatively,

At Flora’s price of $10 per flange:

| Revenue          | $10   | ×   | 10,000 | =   | $100,000 |
|------------------|-------|-----|--------|-----|----------|
| Variable costs   | $3.80 | ×   | 10,000 | =   | 38,000   |
| Fixed costs      |       |     |        |     | *38,000* |
| Operating income |       |     |        |     | $ 24,000 |

Gayle’s Glassworks can sell at a price below $10 per flange and still make a profit. The company earns operating income of $24,000 at a price of $10 per flange. The company will earn operating income as long as the price exceeds $7.60 per flange.

The reason the unit cost decreases significantly is that inventoriable (manufacturing) fixed costs and fixed period (non-manufacturing) costs remain the same regardless of the number of units produced. So, as Gayle’s Glassworks produces more units, fixed costs are spread over more units, and cost per unit decreases. This means that if you use unit costs to make decisions about pricing, and which product to produce, you must be aware that the unit cost only applies to a particular level of output.

**2-28** (20–30 min.) **Inventoriable costs versus period costs.**

1. *Manufacturing-sector companies* purchase materials and components and convert them into different finished goods.

*Merchandising-sector companies* purchase and then sell tangible products without changing their basic form.

*Service-sector companies* provide services or intangible products to their customers—for example, legal advice or audits.

Only manufacturing and merchandising companies have inventories of goods for sale.

2. *Inventoriable costs* are all costs of a product that are regarded as an asset when they are incurred and then become cost of goods sold when the product is sold. These costs for a manufacturing company are included in work-in-process and finished goods inventory (they are “inventoried”) to build up the costs of creating these assets.

*Period costs* are all costs in the income statement other than cost of goods sold. These costs are treated as expenses of the period in which they are incurred because they are presumed not to benefit future periods (or because there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that such benefit exists). Expensing these costs immediately best matches expenses to revenues.

3. (a) Lettuce and tomatoes purchased for resale by Star market—inventoriable cost of a merchandising company. It becomes part of cost of goods sold when the lettuce and tomatoes are sold.

1.  Electricity used for lighting at Maytag refrigerator assembly plant—inventoriable cost of a manufacturing company. It is part of the manufacturing overhead that is included in the manufacturing cost of a refrigerator finished good.

2.  Depreciation on Yahoo!’s computer equipment used to update directories of websites—period cost of a service company. Yahoo! has no inventory of goods for sale and, hence, no inventoriable cost.

3.  Electricity used to provide lighting for Star Market’s store aisles—period cost of a merchandising company. It is a cost that benefits the current period, and it is not traceable to goods purchased for resale.

4.  Depreciation on Maytag’s assembly testing equipment—inventoriable cost of a manufacturing company. It is part of the manufacturing overhead that is included in the manufacturing cost of a refrigerator finished good.

5.  Salaries of Star Market’s marketing personnel—period cost of a merchandising company. It is a cost that is not traceable to goods purchased for resale. It is presumed not to benefit future periods (or at least not to have sufficiently reliable evidence to estimate such future benefits).

6.  Perrier mineral water consumed by Yahoo!’s software engineers—period cost of a service company. Yahoo! has no inventory of goods for sale and, hence, no inventoriable cost.

7.  Salaries of Yahoo!’s marketing personnel—period cost of a service company. Yahoo! has no inventory of goods for sale and, hence, no inventoriable cost.

**
2-35** (15–20 min.) **Interpretation of statements (continuation of 2-34).**

1. The schedule in 2-34 can become a Schedule of Cost of Goods Manufactured and Sold simply by including the beginning and ending finished goods inventory figures in the supporting schedule, rather than directly in the body of the income statement. Note that the term *cost of goods manufactured* refers to the cost of goods brought to completion (finished) during the accounting period, whether they were started before or during the current accounting period. Some of the manufacturing costs incurred are held back as costs of the ending work in process; similarly, the costs of the beginning work in process inventory become a part of the cost of goods manufactured for 2014.

2. The sales manager’s salary would be charged as a marketing cost as incurred by both manufacturing and merchandising companies. It is basically an operating cost that appears below the gross margin line on an income statement. In contrast, an assembler’s wages would be assigned to the products worked on. Thus, the wages cost would be charged to Work-in-Process and would not be expensed until the product is transferred through Finished Goods Inventory to Cost of Goods Sold as the product is sold.

3. The direct-indirect distinction can be resolved only with respect to a particular cost object. For example, in defense contracting, the cost object may be defined as a contract. Then, a plant supervisor working only on that contract will have his or her salary charged directly and wholly to that single contract.

4. Direct materials used = $320,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 units = $320 per unit

Depreciation on plant equipment = $80,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 units = $80 per unit

5. Direct materials unit cost would be unchanged at $320 per unit. Depreciation cost per unit would be $80,000,000 ÷ 1,200,000 = $66.67 per unit. Total direct materials costs would rise by 20% to $384,000,000 ($320 per unit × 1,200,000 units), whereas total depreciation would be unaffected at $80,000,000.

6. Unit costs are averages, and they must be interpreted with caution. The $320 direct materials unit cost is valid for predicting total costs because direct materials is a variable cost; total direct materials costs indeed change as output levels change. However, fixed costs like depreciation must be interpreted quite differently from variable costs. A common error in cost analysis is to regard all unit costs as one—as if all the total costs to which they are related are variable costs. Changes in output levels (the denominator) will affect *total variable costs*, but not *total fixed costs*. Graphs of the two costs may clarify this point; it is safer to think in terms of total costs rather than in terms of unit costs.

3. Design costs and R&D costs may be regarded as product costs in case of contracting with a governmental agency. For example, if the Air Force negotiated to contract with Lockheed to build a new type of supersonic fighter plane, design costs and R&D costs may be included in the contract as product costs.

4. Direct materials used = $112,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 units = $112 per unit

Depreciation on plant and equipment = $8,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 units = $8 per unit

1.  Direct materials unit cost would be unchanged at $112. Depreciation unit cost would be $8,000,000 ÷ 2,000,000 = $4 per unit. Total direct materials costs would rise by 100% to $224,000,000 ($112 per unit × 2,000,000 units). Total depreciation cost of $8,000,000 would remain unchanged.

2.  In this case, equipment depreciation is a variable cost in relation to the unit output. The amount of equipment depreciation will change in direct proportion to the number of units produced.

<!-- -->

1.  Depreciation will be $1 million ($1 × 1 million) when 1 million units are produced.

2.  Depreciation will be $2 million ($1 × 2 million) when 2 million units are produced.

2. Idle time caused by regular machine maintenance, slow order periods, or unexpected mechanical problems is an indirect cost of the product because it is not related to a specific product.

Overtime premium caused by the heavy overall volume of work is also an indirect cost because it is not related to a particular job that happened to be worked on during the overtime hours. If, however, the overtime is the result of a demanding “rush job,” the overtime premium is a direct cost of that job.

**2-40** (30 min.) **Comprehensive problem on unit costs, product costs.**

1. If 2 pounds of direct materials are used to make each unit of finished product, 115,000 units × 2 lbs., or 230,000 lbs. were used at $0.65 per pound of direct materials ($149,500 ÷ 230,000 lbs.). (The direct material costs of $149,500 are direct materials used, not purchased.) Therefore, the ending inventory of direct materials is 2,300 lbs. × $0.65 = $1,495.

2. ***Manufacturing Costs for 115,000 units***

**2-41** (20-25 min.) **Classification of costs; ethics.**

1. Warehousing costs per unit =

> =

If the $3,570,000 is treated as period costs, the entire amount would be expensed during the year as incurred. If it is treated as a product cost, it would be “unitized” at $17 per unit and expensed as each unit of the product is sold. Therefore, if only 190,000 of the 210,000 units are sold, only $3,230,000 ($17 per unit × 190,000 units) of the $3,570,000 would be expensed in the current period. The remaining $3,570,000 – $3,230,000 = $340,000 would be inventoried on the balance sheet until a later period when the units are sold. The value of finished goods inventory can also be calculated directly to be $340,000 ($17 per unit × 20,000 units).

2. No. With respect to classifying costs as product or period costs, this determination is made by GAAP. It is not something that can be justified by the plant manager or plant controller. Even though these costs are in fact related to the product, they are not direct costs of manufacturing the product. GAAP requires that research and development, as well as all costs related to warehousing and distribution of goods, be classified as period costs and expensed in the period they are incurred.

3. Jason Hand would improve his personal bonus and take-home pay by
8% × $340,000 = $27,200

4. The controller should not reclassify costs as product costs just so the plant can reap short-term benefits, including the increase in Hand’s personal year-end bonus. Research and development costs, costs related to the shipping of finished goods, and costs related to warehousing finished goods are all period costs under GAAP and must be treated as such. Changing this classification on Old World’s financial statements would violate GAAP and would likely be considered fraudulent. The idea of costs being classified as product costs versus period costs is to properly reflect on the income statement those costs that are directly related to manufacturing (costs incurred to transform one asset, direct materials into another asset, finished goods) and to properly reflect on the balance sheet those costs that will provide a future benefit (inventory). The controller should not be intimidated by Hand. Hand stands to personally benefit from the reclassification of costs. The controller should insist that he must adhere to GAAP so as not to submit fraudulent financial statements to corporate headquarters. If Hand insists on the reclassification, the controller should raise the issue with the chief financial officer after informing Hand that he is doing so. If, after taking all these steps, there is continued pressure to modify the numbers, the controller should consider resigning from the company rather than engage in unethical behavior.

**2-42** (20–25 min.) **Finding unknown amounts.**

Let G = given, I = inferred

Step 1: Use gross margin formula ***Case 1* *Case 2***

Revenues $48,000 G $47,700 G

Cost of goods sold **A** *31,050* I *30,000* G

Gross margin $16,950 G **C** $17,700 I

Step 2: Use schedule of cost of goods manufactured formula

Direct materials used $12,000 G $18,000 G

Direct manufacturing labor costs 4,500 G 7,500 G

Indirect manufacturing costs *10,500* G **D** *9,750* I

Manufacturing costs incurred 27,000 I 35,250 I

Add beginning work in process, 1/1 *0* G *1,200* G

Total manufacturing costs to account for 27,000 I 36,450 I

Deduct ending work in process, 12/31 *0* G *4,500* G

Cost of goods manufactured $27,000 I $31,950 I

Step 3: Use cost of goods sold formula

Beginning finished goods inventory, 1/1 $ 6,000 G $ 6,000 G

Cost of goods manufactured *27,000* I *31,950* I

Cost of goods available for sale 33,000 I 37,950 I

Ending finished goods inventory, 12/31 **B** *1,950* I *7,950* G

Cost of goods sold $31,050 I $30,000 G

For case 1, do steps 1, 2, and 3 in order.

For case 2, do steps 1, 3, and then 2.
