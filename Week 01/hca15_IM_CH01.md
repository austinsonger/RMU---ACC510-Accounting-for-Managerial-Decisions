1.  **LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

>   Distinguish financial accounting from management accounting.

>   Understand how management accountants affect strategic decisions.

>   Describe the set of business functions in the value chain and identify the
>   dimensions of performance that customers are expecting of companies.

>   Explain the five-step decision-making process and its role in management
>   accounting.

>   Describe three guidelines management accountants follow in supporting
>   managers.

>   Understand how management accounting fits into an organization’s structure.

>   Understand what professional ethics mean to management accountants.

 

1.  **CHAPTER SYNOPSIS**

>   Chapter 1 is an important introductory chapter. The underlying premise of
>   this text, *Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis* (15th ed.), is the
>   importance of cost accounting data in making managerial decisions.
>   Distinction is made between financial accounting and managerial accounting.
>   **Financial accounting** information is reported to external users and used
>   by investors, lenders, suppliers, and other external stakeholders to
>   evaluate and compare companies. It follows prescribed standards and formats.
>   In contrast, **management accounting** provides financial and nonfinancial
>   information to internal users employing whatever format or costing approach
>   that will allow managers to make the best possible business decisions in
>   today’s competitive environment. Cost accounting provides information for
>   both financial accounting and management accounting; in this text the terms
>   *cost accounting* and *management accounting* are used interchangeably.

>   Successful management accounting systems capture and report information that
>   helps managers make decisions to fulfill organizational goals in an
>   effective and efficient manner. Management accounting also provides
>   information critical to the planning and control decisions of managers.

>   A five-step decision process is introduced to guide successful decision
>   making: identify the problem, obtain information, make predictions about
>   outcomes, make a decision, and implement the decision.

>   Key guidelines for management accountants include: cost-benefit analysis,
>   behavioral considerations, technical considerations, and different costs for
>   different purposes. Understanding of these guidelines is essential for the
>   student to have a solid foundation for material that is presented later in
>   the text.

>   As those responsible for the integrity of the accounting information used by
>   external and internal parties, accountants must maintain the highest of
>   ethical standards. They must take special care to avoid the appearance of
>   ethical improprieties—not only avoid unethical behavior, but avoid the
>   appearance of such. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, passed in response to
>   several large accounting scandals, imposes strict ethical standards on
>   accountants. Professional associations such as the AICPA and the IMA not
>   only impose additional standards on their members but also provide resources
>   that help members identify ethical issues and possible courses of action
>   when ethical dilemmas confront them.

 

**III. Points of Emphasis**

1.  Make sure that the students understand the perspective of cost accounting
    and how it differs from that of financial accounting.

2.  The cost-benefit ratio is pervasive throughout the text. The students should
    grasp this concept early or they will not fully understand cost accounting.

3.  Another recurring theme throughout the text is the five-step decision model.
    Emphasize this concept and be certain the students are operationally
    familiar with it.

4.  The guidelines to management accounting covered in Learning Objective 5 give
    the student a proper perspective in order to “do” management accounting.

5.  It is helpful and sets an ethical tone for the class if you go over the
    points included in the IMA Code of Ethical Conduct. Discuss the definitions
    of the terms covered in the Code, making certain that the students have a
    grasp of what is involved in ethical conduct.

 

**IV. CHAPTER OUTLINE**

\| **LEARNING**

| **OBJECTIVE**                    | 1 |
|----------------------------------|---|
| Distinguish financial accounting |   |

… reporting on past performance to external users

from management accounting

… helping managers make decisions \| \| \|

1.  Accounting systems process economic events and transactions into information
    helpful to managers. This data is collected, categorized, summarized, and
    analyzed.

2.  Accounting systems provide information found in the financial statements as
    well as in internal performance reports.

3.  Managers use this information to administer the activities of their area of
    responsibility.

4.  Information needs may vary depending on managerial needs.

>   Teaching point. It is good here to stop and evaluate the different needs of
>   different users within the company. Sales managers are interested in sales
>   data by region or sales person; distribution managers may be interested in
>   orders by geographic location or requested due dates; manufacturing managers
>   may be interested in quantities of products ordered so production scheduling
>   can occur. All of these are interested in different aspects of the sales
>   data.

1.  Management accounting has a different focus than financial accounting. The
    management accountant reports financial and nonfinancial information that
    helps managers make decisions that will help the company achieve its goals
    or implement its strategy. It is forward-looking.

>   Teaching point. Students need to understand from the start the
>   “decision-making” focus of management accounting.

1.  Management accounting reports information in a manner that will help
    managers do their jobs better and are not restricted by Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.

>   Teaching point. This is a good time to introduce an overriding element of
>   management accounting—the cost-benefit ratio. Engage the students in a
>   cost-benefit analysis from personal experience. For example, compare the
>   cost of getting a college education (including lost wages) with the
>   benefits. Link the discussion to the original decision to (1) attend college
>   and (2) the choice of a college.

1.  Financial accounting has a historical focus, as it reports the results of
    operations to external parties. These reports must adhere to Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles.

2.  Cost accounting and financial accounting do not operate independently. Cost
    accounting, in addition to providing information for management accounting
    decision-making needs, also provides data to meet financial accounting
    inventory-valuation needs.

>   (Exhibit 1-1 summarizes the major differences between financial and
>   managerial accounting.)

1.  **Cost management** describes the approaches and activities of managers to
    use resources to increase the value to customers and to achieve
    organizational goals. It is not just about reducing costs, but involves
    revenue and profit planning as well.

>   Teaching point. Students are frequently confused by cost accounting
>   terminology. Explain that different practices arise in different companies.
>   Because cost accounting is not for external reporting purposes, there is
>   frequently a lack of communication among companies, and no standard
>   terminology developed. Many cost accounting terms lack a uniform definition,
>   and many practices may go by different names.

|------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Understand how management accountants affect strategic decisions |   |

… they provide information about the sources of competitive advantage \| \| \|

>   2.1 **Strategy** describes how an organization will compete and the
>   opportunities management should pursue. It involves matching its
>   capabilities with the opportunities in the marketplace to accomplish its
>   objective.

>   Teaching point. Emphasize here the difference in strategic and tactical
>   decision making. Strategy focuses on the long term and is performed by upper
>   management. Tactical decision making is short term and is in the realm of
>   lower to middle management. For students a strategic decision is their
>   choice of a college and a major. A tactical decision would be what class to
>   study for tonight.

1.  Two broad strategies include competing on the basis of price or on the basis
    of product differentiation.

>   Teaching point. Have the students brainstorm for names of companies that
>   have pursued either strategy. How have they implemented the strategy of
>   price competition? How have they differentiated the product?

1.  **Strategic cost management** describes cost management specifically focused
    on strategic issues. This seeks answers to questions such as:

-   Who are our most important customers and how do we deliver value to them?

-   What substitute products exist in the market? How do they differ from ours?

-   What is our most critical capability? What do we do best?

-   Will adequate cash be available to fund the strategy or is outside financing
    needed?

| Describe the set of business functions in the value chain and identify the dimensions of performance that customers are expecting of companies |   |

… R&D, design, production, marketing, distribution, and customer service
supported by administration to achieve cost and efficiency, quality, time, and
innovation \| \| \|

>   3.1 The **value chain** is the sequence of business functions in which
>   customer usefulness is added to products or services.

>   (Exhibit 1-2 illustrates the six business functions in the value chain.)

1.  **Research and development** involves generating and experimenting with new
    ideas related to new products, services, or processes.

2.  The **design** function undertakes detailed planning and engineering of
    products, services, or processes.

3.  **Production** is acquiring, coordinating, and assembling resources to
    produce a product or deliver a service.

4.  **Marketing** involves promoting and selling products or services to
    customers.

5.  **Distribution** is the process of delivering the products or services to
    customers.

6.  **Customer service** provides after-sale support to customers.

>   Teaching point. All of these functions are important and interrelated. The
>   failure of a company to deliver any one of these adequately will have a
>   negative impact on the others. Ask the students about negative experiences
>   they have had with a company and which element of the value chain was
>   involved. Probe further, exploring how this failure impacted the student’s
>   perception of the company in other areas.

1.  Management accountants are involved in the value chain as they keep track of
    costs incurred in each category. This information helps managers evaluate
    cost-benefit trade-offs.

2.  Related to the value chain is the supply chain. Whereas the value chain is
    internal, the **supply chain** involves the flow of goods, services, and
    information from the initial source of materials and services to the
    delivery to consumers. The value chain can involve one or many different
    organizations.

>   (Exhibit 1-3 illustrates an overview of the value chain.)

1.  The value chain and supply chain should be used by the company to deliver
    improving levels of performance for the customer. Key success factors in
    accomplishing this delivery include the following:

-   **Cost and efficiency—**Determine what customers are willing to pay for a
    product or service and set a *target price.* By subtracting the desired
    profit, the company can then work to accomplish its *target cost.*

-   **Quality—**Customers expect high levels of quality. Total Quality
    Management (TQM) is a philosophy that seeks to improve operations throughout
    the company and exceed customer expectations.

>   Teaching point. Emphasize that quality does not have to be the most
>   expensive. A product or service can be a quality product or service if it
>   conforms to its intent. This is quality of conformance. Quality of design
>   relates to products being thought of as being top-notch. A Rolls Royce
>   automobile has quality of design. There is a more thorough discussion of
>   quality in Chapter 19.

-   **Time—**New product development time and customer response time are two
    elements of this factor. In today’s time-conscious society, the customer
    wants the product or service now. Any delay is unacceptable. A company that
    can compete on the basis of time, whether in development or delivery is one
    that has an edge in today’s market.

>   Teaching point. When Fred Smith founded Federal Express to deliver packages
>   overnight, many thought he would not succeed. However, Smith realized an
>   unmet demand for quick delivery.

-   **Innovation—**A constant flow of new products or services is the basis for
    ongoing company success.

-   **Sustainability—**Companies increasingly apply the key success factors of
    cost and efficiency, quality, time and innovation to promote sustainability.

| **OBJECTIVE**                                                                       | 4 |

… identify the problem and uncertainties, obtain information, make predictions
about the future, make decisions by choosing among alternatives, and implement
the decision, evaluate performance, and learn to do planning and control

and its role in management accounting

… planning and control of operations and activities \| \| \|

1.  Managers should go through a routine process in order to make effective
    decisions. This five-step decision process can be utilized to make a variety
    of decisions.

-   **Identify the problems and uncertainties.** What are the choices that are
    being faced and where do the uncertainties lie?

-   **Obtain information.** Gather information before making a decision helps
    the manager to make a more informed decision.

>   Teaching point. Guard against information overload, or obtaining too much
>   information. Narrow the choices so the volume of information is manageable.
>   Too much information can lead to “paralysis of analysis,” or the inability
>   to formulate a viable solution.

-   **Make predictions about the future.** On the basis of the information
    obtained attempt to predict the outcome of each course of action.

-   **Make decisions by choosing among alternatives.** The information has been
    gathered and projections made. Select an alternative.

>   Teaching point. Do not shy away from making a decision. Someone once asked
>   the President of General Motors if he had ever made a bad decision. His
>   response was that to reach the level of success he had achieved, you were
>   doing good to bat .500. You are going to make bad decisions, learn from
>   them.

>   Collectively, the four preceding steps are known as **planning**—the
>   selection of organizational goals, predicting results under alternative ways
>   of achieving these goals, deciding how to attain these goals, and
>   communicating the goals to the entire organization.

>   A **budget** has been described as the quantitative expression of a proposed
>   plan of action. It is a planning tool.

>   **Control** is the action taken to implement the planning decisions
>   represented by the budget.

-   **Implement the decision, evaluate performance, and learn.** All the effort
    expended in steps 1 through 4 is useless unless the decision is put into
    action.

>   Teaching point. Most people have been associated with organizations or
>   individuals who would have great plans, and would go through steps 1 through
>   4 of the process, only to fail to implement the decision. A colleague once
>   came into work one morning, announcing an intention to return to school for
>   an advanced degree. Fifteen years later, that colleague is still in the same
>   company, without the degree.

>   Once implemented, the decision must be monitored. This is performance
>   evaluation. One way of doing this is by comparing the budget with the actual
>   results. This makes budgeting a control tool in addition to a planning tool.
>   Often this is accomplished by the use of a performance report.

>   Teaching point. Monitoring also helps keep the plan (or budget) realistic.
>   If the person proposing the project knows the results will not be monitored,
>   there is a tendency to overstate the benefits so the project will receive
>   approval.

>   **Learn.** If the results were not as planned, find out why. Use this
>   information to improve the decision-making process for future decisions.

>   Teaching point. These guidelines are the foundation for the rest of the
>   text. Students must understand that everything that is to follow must be
>   filtered through the lens of cost-benefit, behavioral and technical
>   considerations, and different costs for different purposes.

>   5.1 **Cost-benefit approach.** Always ask if the benefits from undertaking
>   the activity exceed the costs of doing so.

>   5.2 **Behavioral and technical considerations.** Consider the motivational

>   managers with appropriate information at appropriate intervals to assist in
>   decision making.

>   5.3 **Different costs for different purposes.** Much of this book is about
>   alternative ways to compute costs. In determining the cost, the first
>   question that should be asked is “What is the purpose of this cost number?”
>   Performance evaluation, external reporting, and internal decision making are
>   three different purposes that might require a different view of cost.

| Understand how management accounting fits into an organization’s structure |   |

… for example, the responsibilities of the controller \| \| \|

>   6.1 Most organizations distinguish between **line** and **staff**
>   relationships. **Line management** is directly responsible for attaining the
>   goals of the organization. Production is a line function. **Staff
>   management** supports line management with advice and assistance. Accounting
>   and human resources are two examples of staff management functions.

>   6.2 The **Chief Financial Officer** or **CFO** (also called the finance
>   director) is the executive responsible for overseeing the financial
>   operations of an organization. Included among the responsibilities of the
>   CFO are several functions:

-   **Controller** provides financial information to managers and shareholders
    and oversees the overall operations of the accounting system.

-   The **treasury** function includes banking, financing, investments, and cash
    management.

-   **Risk management** includes managing the financial risk of interest rate
    and exchange rate changes as well as derivatives management.

-   **Taxation** includes income taxes, sales taxes, and international tax
    planning.

-   **Investor relations** responds to and interacts with shareholders.

-   **Strategic planning** includes defining strategy and allocating resources
    to implement strategy.

>   The scope and importance of an **internal audit** has increased in recent
>   years and now includes reviewing and analyzing financial and other records
>   to attest to the integrity of the organization’s financial reports and
>   adherence to policies and procedures.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Understand what professional ethics means to management accountants |   |

… for example, management accountants must maintain integrity and credibility in
every aspect of their job \| \| \|

1.  Accountants have a special obligation regarding ethics, as they are
    responsible for the integrity of the financial information provided to
    external and internal users.

2.  Sarbanes-Oxley focuses on improving internal control, corporate governance,
    monitoring of managers, and disclosure practices of public corporations.
    This legislation brought an increase in the ethical standards of managers
    and accountants.

3.  The **Institute of Management Accountants (IMA)** is the largest association
    of management accountants in the .

4.  The IMA offers professional certification in the form of the **CMA**
    designation—**Certified Management Accountant.** This certification
    represents a demonstration of technical competency in financial and
    managerial accounting and holds the CMA to high ethical standards.

5.  The IMA *Standards for Ethical Conduct for Practitioners of Management
    Accounting and Financial Management* presents guidelines on issues relating
    to competence, confidentiality, integrity, and credibility.

>   (Exhibit 1-7 is a copy of the IMA Ethical Conduct Statement.)

1.  In addition to the *Standards,* the IMA has an ethics hotline to assist
    members in resolving their ethical dilemmas.

>   Teaching point. Students sometimes don’t realize the importance of proper
>   ethical behavior. A sign on a church once read “Integrity—Gained over a
>   lifetime, lost in an instant.” Emphasize that integrity, once lost, is
>   difficult to regain. Also, it is important for the accountant to avoid even
>   the appearance of unethical conduct.
